He dreamt of adventures beyond the horizon, of heroes and heroines, of magic that whispered in the wind. Yet, his reality was firmly rooted in the cobblestone streets of Eldoria, where the most significant event was the annual Harvest Festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "One balmy summer afternoon, as Finn meandered through the village's modest library, his fingers brushed against a spine that seemed to hum with a peculiar energy. It was an old, leather-bound book, its title faded with time. Curiosity piqued, Finn checked out the book and hurried home, unaware that his life was about to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he turned the pages, the world around him began to shift. The walls of his room stretched and blurred until they were no more, replaced by an emerald forest that shimmered under a sky painted with twilight. Finn stood at the threshold of an adventure he had only dared to dream of.\n",
      "\n",
      "He learned that this realm was known as Thalion, a land suspended in perpetual summer, where the sun kissed the earth in an endless embrace. However, Thalion was in peril. An ancient darkness, long forgotten, had begun to stir in the depths of the Shadowmere, threatening to engulf the land in eternal night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to saving Thalion, as the book revealed, rested with the Last Summer Bloom, a mythical flower said to possess the power of the sun itself. But the bloom had not been seen for centuries, hidden away by the winds of fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guided by the wisdom of the book, Finn embarked on a journey across Thalion. He crossed paths with a cast of characters who would become the unlikeliest of allies: Aria, a fierce warrior with a melody for every mood; Tolen, a mage whose spells often misfired with humorous results; and Lirra, a rogue with a heart of gold, hidden beneath layers of cunning and stealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, they braved the trials of the Whispering Woods, outwitted the cunning River Sirens, and scaled the peaks of the Everfrost Mountains. Their bond, forged in the fires of adversity, became Finn's greatest strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the final leaves of summer began to fall, Finn and his companions reached the heart of the Shadowmere. There, amidst the darkness, they found the Last Summer Bloom, its light a beacon of hope. But the ancient darkness would not yield so easily. A battle ensued, where courage and friendship were tested against the might of shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, it was Finn's belief in the power of stories, of endings that lead to new beginnings, that turned the tide. He realized that the Last Summer Bloom needed not just sunlight but the light within, the light of hearts unbroken by despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the darkness vanquished, Thalion was bathed in a light brighter than the first dawn. The land healed, and the perpetual summer gave way to the natural cycle of seasons, each one a promise of rebirth and renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finn awoke in his room, the book closed beside him. The adventure had ended, or perhaps, it was just beginning. For in his hand, he held a single petal from the Last Summer Bloom, a reminder that even in the most ordinary of places, magic awaits, ready to be discovered.\n",
      "\n",

The script is achieving this through several steps - tokenizing the text data into sentences, initializing a vector store with sentence-wise context from the novels, and setting up a retriever. Let's dive deeper into each component and understand the role of `ThreadPoolExecutor` in optimizing this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to tokenize text into sentences\n",
    "def tokenize_text(text):\n",
    "    return sent_tokenize(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a function named `tokenize_text` is defined to tokenize the input text into individual sentences using the `sent_tokenize` function. This step is crucial to break down the texts into manageable and analyzable units, which will later be used to retrieve relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Processing Using ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start the timer\n",
    "start_time = timeit.default_timer()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is introduced to optimize the tokenization process. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><b>\n",
    "ThreadPoolExecutor is a class in the concurrent.futures module that provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. It creates a pool of threads, each of which can run a task. In this script, it is utilized to parallelize the tokenization of texts from multiple documents, significantly speeding up the process compared to sequential execution. The `executor.map` function is used to map the `tokenize_text` function to each text in `processed_texts.values()`, allowing for concurrent tokenization. Utilizing ThreadPoolExecutor is particularly beneficial when dealing with a large number of documents, as it can help to vastly reduce the overall processing time.\n",
    "</b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregating Results and Initializing Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Combine the results from all threads into the sentences list\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    sentences.extend(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize a vector store with sentence-wise context from the novels\n",
    "vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(sentences, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Post parallel processing, the results from all threads are aggregated into a single list of sentences. Following this, a vector store is initialized using the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library, creating embeddings for each sentence to facilitate quick and efficient similarity searches later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Set up a retriever that can find the most relevant context based on the user's question\n",
    "retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a retriever is set up using the vector store, which will be used to find the most relevant context based on the user's question during the response generation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing the Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Stop the timer and print the total time taken\n",
    "elapsed_time = timeit.default_timer() - start_time\n",
    "print(f\"Total time taken: {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the total time taken for the entire operation (from tokenization to retriever setup) is calculated and printed, allowing for performance monitoring and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment of the script is crucial in setting up the backend system that enables the intelligent and context-aware responses that Langchain is known for. It ensures that the system is equipped to analyze and respond to user queries with contextually relevant and insightful responses.\n",

      "Bot: The passage you've referenced, while paraphrased, evokes the central themes and character dynamics of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick.\" Captain Ahab's obsession with the white whale, Moby Dick, is not just a personal vendetta but becomes emblematic of a deeper, more existential quest that both isolates and, paradoxically, connects him to his crew and humanity at large. \n",
      "\n",
      "When considering the question \"Is Ahab, Ahab?\" in the context of the novel, it invites a reflection on the nature of identity, obsession, and the human condition. Ahab, as the captain of the Pequod, is defined by his single-minded pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick, which has come to consume his entire being. This obsession is so intense that it transforms his identity, making him synonymous with his quest. Ahab is no longer just a man; he embodies the relentless, destructive pursuit of an insurmountable goal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The line \"Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?\" suggests a unity between Ahab and his crew, born out of the shared experience of the hunt. While the crew may not share Ahab's personal vendetta against the whale, they are inexorably tied to his quest. Their fates are intertwined with his, for better or worse. This connection highlights the theme of collective human endeavor and the ways in which individual obsessions can engulf and define a community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahab's response, \"Hast seen the white whale?\" to the question about his identity further underscores the extent to which his quest has consumed him. His identity is so entangled with the pursuit of Moby Dick that he can only see himself through this lens. This moment encapsulates the tragedy of Ahab: his inability to disentangle his self from his obsession leads to his downfall and that of his crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "In \"Moby-Dick,\" Melville explores the destructive nature of obsession, the elusiveness of truth and knowledge, and the complexities of human nature. Ahab's character serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing a single goal or vendetta to define one's existence. His pursuit of Moby Dick is not just a hunt for a whale but a metaphor for the human condition, reflecting the eternal struggle between man and nature, knowledge and the unknown, and ultimately, between man and his own demons. \n",
      "\n",

His identity is inseparable from his quest, making him a compelling and tragic figure whose story resonates with the timeless inquiry into the nature of obsession and identity.\n",

Captain Ahab, the monomaniacal commander of the whaling ship Pequod, is indeed a multifaceted character whose obsession with the eponymous white whale, Moby Dick, drives not only his fate but also shapes the destiny of his crew. The line \"None. Please provide a detailed response based on the context: is Ahab, Ahab? Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?\" can be seen as an exploration of Ahab's identity and how it becomes inseparable from his obsession.\n",

The dialogue \"Hast seen the white whale?\" \"Gritted Ahab in reply. So Ahab.\" succinctly captures Ahab's singular focus and determination. His identity is so intertwined with his quest that interactions with others often circle back to his obsession. When Ahab inquires about the white whale, it is a reflection of how his entire being is consumed by his vendetta against Moby Dick. This obsession is so intense that it defines his interactions, his command, and ultimately, his very essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question \"Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?\" reflects on the crew's entanglement in Ahab's obsession. While not all share his monomania, the crew of the Pequod is drawn into Ahab's vortex of vengeance. This shared fate raises questions about collective responsibility, leadership, and the human capacity for obsession. Ahab's charisma and authoritative command compel his crew to follow him, despite the perilous nature of his quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a broader sense, Ahab's struggle with the white whale can be interpreted as humanity's struggle against the incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature and fate. Ahab personifies the human desire to conquer and understand the unknown, regardless of the cost. His relentless pursuit of Moby Dick, despite the warnings and omens, illustrates the dangerous allure of obsession and the potential for it to consume one's identity and reason.\n",

    "## Breaking down the output generation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input**: \n",
    "   The user initiates the conversation with a query: \"does Ahab kill the whale?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invoking the Chain with the Question**:\n",
    "   The `get_response` function is activated with the user's query, starting the chain of processes which is indicated by the message \"Invoking the chain with the question...\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieving Relevant Context**:\n",
    "   At this stage, the `get_context` function is invoked, denoted by the message \"Retrieving relevant context...\". This function utilizes the retriever (initialized earlier in the script) to find the top 5 documents or text matches that are pertinent to the question from the stored data (the tokenized sentences from the novels). These matches are determined based on the similarity between the content in the datastore and the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Formulating the Answer**:\n",
    "   Following the retrieval of the relevant context, the script transitions to the answer formulation phase, represented by the message \"Formulating the answer...\". Here, the `package_input` function takes charge, packaging the retrieved context and the initial question into a dictionary format. This input is then processed through a chat prompt template, instructing the LLM to consider the information from the novels and formulate a detailed response based on the retrieved context and the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generating the Response**:\n",
    "   The packaged input is then supplied to the LLM (specified as \"gpt-4-turbo-preview\" in your script) to generate a response. The LLM analyzes the provided context and the question, crafting a detailed response in return. The `StrOutputParser` comes into play at the end of the chain to parse the raw LLM output into a string format, which is then ready to be presented as the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output**:\n",
    "   The response generated by the LLM is displayed on the console as the Bot's reply. In this instance, the response is a comprehensive analysis of Ahab's character and his obsession with Moby Dick, grounded in the context extracted from the novels stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Termination**:\n",
    "   If the user inputs 'quit', the script breaks the loop, concluding the conversation with a farewell message, \"Goodbye!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the script you shared functions to find relevant text matches based on the user's query, and then employs the LLM to scrutinize these matches to construct a detailed, context-rich response. The generated response offers a profound analysis of the query, taking into account the context obtained from the novels in the database.\n"
