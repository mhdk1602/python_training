    "## Data Storage and Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Data storage is a critical component in the data engineering pipeline. It's vital to understand the various data storage systems and how to interact with them using Python. In this section, we will look at different types of data storage systems, how to read and write data in Python, and some of the best practices for managing data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Different Types of Data Storage Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several data storage systems, each designed to serve different purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "File systems are fundamental for storing files and directories. They can be as simple as storing files on your computer or more complex like distributed file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), NTFS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are used for storing structured data. They use tables to store data and are excellent for operations that require transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are ideal for storing unstructured or semi-structured data. They donâ€™t rely on the traditional table structure and are highly scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: `MongoDB`, `Apache Cassandra`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Lakes\n",
    "\n",
    "Data lakes are used for storing a vast amount of raw data, both structured and unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: `Amazon S3`, `Azure Data Lake Store`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-memory Data Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory data stores hold the data in memory which is faster compared to disk storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: `Redis`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading and Writing Data from Various Storage Systems in Python\n",

    "Relational databases are widely used for storing structured data. They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each table represents an entity or concept. The relationships between tables are defined by keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
