    "analysis_result": "Here is a concise summary of the key points and insights from the text segment:\n\nThe passage describes Tom Sawyer successfully stealing a skiff and beginning a nighttime voyage on the river. After rowing for 12-15 minutes, he swims ashore downstream and sneaks back to his aunt's house through back alleys. He peeks in the window and sees Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and another woman talking by a bed. Tom carefully and quietly opens the door enough to squeeze through without being detected. Just as he's entering, Aunt Polly notices the candle flickering from the open door. Tom hides under the bed just in time before being seen. The passage captures Tom's mischievous adventures and close calls with stealth and suspense."
