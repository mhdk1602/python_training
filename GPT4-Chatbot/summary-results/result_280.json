Judge Thatcher, Becky's father, was deeply moved by Tom's noble lie and praised it as being worthy of standing alongside George Washington's famous cherry tree story. Becky was in awe of her father's reaction. The Judge hoped Tom would become a great lawyer or soldier one day, planning to send him to military academy and law school. \n\nMeanwhile, Huck Finn's newfound wealth and living with the Widow Douglas thrust him uncomfortably into society.
