They fell into a stupor of sleep for an unknown period of time before waking up disoriented, unsure if it was Sunday or Monday. Becky was overcome with sorrow, having lost all hope. Tom tried shouting for help, but the echoes were too haunting. As hunger tormented them again, they ate the last of Tom's cake, which only whetted their appetite more. Eventually, Tom thought he heard a faint, far-off shout. He responded and started leading Becky in that direction, straining to hear the sound again, which seemed a little closer, leaving the reader in suspense about their potential rescue."
