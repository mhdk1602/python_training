She is surprised to see Tom, assuming he had run off long ago to play instead of doing his chore of whitewashing the fence. When she inspects the fence, she is astonished to find Tom has not only completely whitewashed it, but coated it repeatedly and even added streaks to the ground. Aunt Polly compliments Tom's rare work ethic, saying he can work when he wants to, though admitting he seldom wants to. She then allows him to go play after completing the fence so diligently."
