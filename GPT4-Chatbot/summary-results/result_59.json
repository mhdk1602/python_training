Instead of lying, Tom admits he was talking to Huckleberry Finn, shocking the master and students. As punishment, the master whips Tom and orders him to sit with the girls as a warning. However, Tom is not truly abashed but filled with worshipful awe, as his tardiness allowed him to sit near the girl he has a crush on. The scene highlights Tom's mischievousness and willingness to endure punishment to be near his love interest, while also capturing the strict disciplinary methods of the time period's schoolhouses."
