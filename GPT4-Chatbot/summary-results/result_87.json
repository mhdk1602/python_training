They realize that if Dr. Robinson dies from his injuries, Injun Joe could be hanged for the crime. However, they are worried that Injun Joe might kill them if they reveal what they saw. \n\nThey consider letting the usually drunk Muff Potter take the blame, since he was knocked unconscious during the incident and may not have seen or known what really happened. Tom and Huck speculate that Potter's drunkenness could have made him unaware or unable to be affected by the blow he received.\n\nThe two friends grapple with the moral dilemma of whether to come forward with the truth about Injun Joe's actions, risking their own lives, or allowing an innocent but intoxicated man to potentially take the fall for the crime."
