They talk about superstitious beliefs related to using bread with quicksilver and incantations to help locate drowned bodies. Tom insists the incantations must be said, even if silently, for the bread to work properly in finding the drowned person. Joe and Huck express their curiosity and wish they could know who the potential victim is. The passage captures the boys' imaginative yet somewhat misinformed ideas about drowning incidents and associated rituals or folk remedies. Their conversation reveals their youthful speculation mixed with rural superstitions common in their era."
