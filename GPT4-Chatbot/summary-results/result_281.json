After being taken in by the Widow Douglas, Huck finds himself confined by the rules and expectations imposed upon him, such as having to study, attend church, and speak properly. Unable to bear these miseries, he runs away after three weeks. The widow and the public search frantically for him until Tom Sawyer discovers Huck hiding in an abandoned slaughter-house, unkempt and content in his old, ragged clothes. When urged to return home, Huck expresses his inability to conform to the widow's ways, as he is unaccustomed to the structured lifestyle and rules of civilization."
