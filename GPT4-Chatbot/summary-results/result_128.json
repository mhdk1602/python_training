She acknowledges that while Tom was mischievous and full of \"devilment\", he was also kind-hearted and unselfish at his core. Aunt Polly expresses deep remorse for times she punished Tom unfairly, like whipping him for taking spoiled cream she had thrown out herself. \n\nMrs. Harper, another woman present, empathizes with Aunt Polly's grief over losing Tom, sharing a similar story about her own son Joe's mischievousness. Both women lament that they'll never see their beloved, troublemaking boys again in this life.\n\nThe text captures the profound sorrow of losing a child, despite their flaws, as well as the guilt parents can feel over harsh discipline in hindsight. It highlights the unconditional love between a parent/guardian and child."
