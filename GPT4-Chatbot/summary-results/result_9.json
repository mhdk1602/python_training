Tom initially gets the better of the new boy, sitting on him and pounding him until he cries \"enough.\" However, after Tom lets him up and gloats, the new boy throws a rock at Tom's back when he turns away, then runs home. Tom chases him but the new boy's mother comes out and scolds Tom, calling him vicious and vulgar and ordering him away. Tom leaves but vows to get revenge on the new boy later for throwing the rock cowardly after surrendering.
