They seem shaken and pale, dropping their pipes and bailing furiously. Joe feebly suggests going to find his lost knife, with Tom offering to help search separately. \n\nAfter waiting an hour, Huck finds them asleep in the woods, looking pale but appearing to have resolved some trouble. At supper, they are not talkative and claim to feel unwell from something they ate. Around midnight, an oppressive atmosphere arises, and the boys huddle by the fire in the blackness, waiting in solemn hush as if something foreboding is about to occur.\n\nThe passage builds a sense of unease and mystery around whatever incident Tom and Joe went through earlier involving their lost knives, leaving the reader to ponder what may have truly happened."
