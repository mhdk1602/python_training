The storm was extremely powerful, with high winds, heavy rain, and lightning that seemed capable of destroying the entire island. After the storm subsided, the boys returned to their camp to find the large sycamore tree that sheltered their beds had been blasted by lightning. Everything in the camp was drenched by the rain, including their campfire. Despite their distress, the boys managed to coax the fire back to life by gathering dry bark and shreds from under sheltered logs. They then built a roaring fire by piling on large dead branches, suggesting their resilience and ability to adapt to difficult situations in the wilderness."
