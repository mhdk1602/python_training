This took precedence over Tom's interest in Injun Joe and the treasure for the time being. Tom and Becky spent an enjoyable day playing with their schoolmates. Becky convinced her mother to allow a long-promised picnic the next day, much to Tom and Becky's delight. Invitations went out and the village children eagerly prepared. Tom stayed up late hoping to hear a signal from Huck about the treasure, but was disappointed. The next morning, the high-spirited children gathered at Judge Thatcher's house ready for the picnic, which would be chaperoned by a few young adults rather than elderly folks per the custom."
