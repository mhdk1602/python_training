Some whispering had occurred due to the arrival of visitors - a lawyer, an elderly man, a well-dressed middle-aged gentleman likely with his wife, and a young girl child. Tom Sawyer, one of the students, had been restless but becomes completely delighted and starts \"showing off\" when he sees the young girl arrive. He is still haunted by the memory of being humiliated in her garden previously, but this memory is being washed away by his current happiness at her presence. The passage captures Tom's infatuation with the girl and his attempts to impress her through misbehavior."
