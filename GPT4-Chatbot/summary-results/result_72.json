He first considers being a clown, but quickly dismisses that as too frivolous. He then envisions becoming a celebrated soldier returning from war, or joining the Indians and becoming a fearsome war chief. However, his grandest fantasy is that of becoming a notorious pirate captain. He imagines commanding a pirate ship called the \"Spirit of the Storm\", plundering the seas, and one day returning to his village as a weathered, infamous figure stalking into church decked out in pirate garb. The boy's overactive imagination conjures increasingly romanticized visions of living an adventurous, legendary life far removed from the mundane existence he currently knows."
