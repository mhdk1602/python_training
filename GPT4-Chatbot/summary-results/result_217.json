Tom goes to inquire about the room and finds that in the best tavern, Room 2 is occupied by a young lawyer. However, in a less ostentatious tavern, Room 2 is kept locked all the time, and no one is seen entering or leaving it except at night. The tavern-keeper's son believes the room is haunted and saw a light in it the previous night. Tom concludes this is likely the Room 2 they are after. He plans to get all the door keys they can find, including his aunt's, in order to try and gain access to the mysterious locked room through the back alley door."
