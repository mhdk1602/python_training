However, his happiness is disrupted when he encounters a well-dressed, affluent-looking boy, who is a newcomer to the poor village of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe passage highlights the stark contrast between Tom's shabby appearance and the newcomer's neat and fashionable attire, which makes Tom feel increasingly self-conscious and envious. The tension builds as the two boys circle each other silently, sizing each other up, until Tom finally breaks the silence by challenging the newcomer to a fight, saying, \"I can lick you!\"\n\nThe key points and insights conveyed in the passage include the simple pleasures of childhood, the jarring effect of encountering someone from a different social class, and the underlying insecurities and competitive nature of young boys."
