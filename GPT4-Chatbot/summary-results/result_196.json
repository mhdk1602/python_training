The key points are:\n\n1. Robbers often hide their loot and forget the markings or die before retrieving it.\n2. The markings are usually coded in symbols or \"hy'roglyphics\" that take time to decipher.\n3. Tom suggests that the treasure is typically buried under haunted houses, on islands, or under dead trees with a single limb.\n4. Huck is excited by the prospect of finding a pot of rusty coins or a chest full of diamonds.\n5. Tom acknowledges that searching all potential locations would take the entire summer, but the potential reward of finding treasure makes it worthwhile.\n\nThe conversation captures the adventurous spirit and youthful imagination of the two boys, who are eager to embark on a treasure hunt, despite the challenges and uncertainties involved."
