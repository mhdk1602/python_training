Huck has caught a tick, which impresses Tom. Tom offers to trade one of his teeth for the tick. After some negotiation, Huck agrees and they make the trade, both feeling they got a good deal. \n\nThe scene then shifts to Tom arriving at the schoolhouse in a purposeful manner, hanging up his hat and taking his seat with alacrity, as the teacher watches from his raised chair. The text captures the playful bargaining between the two boys over what seems a trivial possession to adults - a tick - but is prized by them. It also sets the stage for a classroom scene involving Tom."
