Huck initially thinks the money was stolen from a place called No. 2, but Tom reveals that the money is actually hidden in a cave. Tom is very confident about this and promises to give Huck his prized possessions if the money isn't found in the cave as he claims. Huck agrees to go with Tom to retrieve the money from the cave, as long as they can find their way there and back without getting lost. Tom assures Huck it's about 5 miles into the cave where the money is located. However, Huck expresses some doubt about being able to walk that far in his current condition after being bedridden for a few days."
