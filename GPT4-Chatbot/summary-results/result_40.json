It highlights how learning Bible verses and gaining knowledge as a child can shape someone into a great and good person later in life. The superintendent gave the boy Thomas a beautiful Bible to keep and encouraged him to learn. However, when asked to name the first two appointed disciples, Thomas is hesitant and embarrassed, unable to answer the simple question. This disappoints the adult speaking to him, who had high hopes that Thomas had retained the religious knowledge imparted to him. The passage underscores the value placed on religious learning for children, but also hints at the potential disconnect between the lessons taught and what is truly absorbed and remembered."
