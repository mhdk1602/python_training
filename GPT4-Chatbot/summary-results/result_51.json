His cousin Sid gets alarmed and tells Aunt Polly that Tom is dying. Aunt Polly rushes upstairs, panicked, only to find Tom faking severe pain from a sore toe he claims is \"mortified\" (severely infected). When Aunt Polly sees through his act, Tom admits he was exaggerating because of a loose, aching tooth. The scene highlights Tom's mischievous nature and ability to vividly act out imaginary scenarios, as well as Aunt Polly's concerned but level-headed response when she realizes Tom's antics. The humorous situation arises from Tom's dramatic performance and Aunt Polly's temporary alarm before restoring order."
