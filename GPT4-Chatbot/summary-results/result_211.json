They had been treasure-hunting and Joe's knife struck something buried, which turned out to be an iron-bound box containing thousands of dollars' worth of gold coins. The boys watching from above were just as excited by the discovery. The text suggests the money may have belonged to Murrel's gang of outlaws who were said to have operated in that area one summer long ago. The find represents a fortuitous and valuable treasure uncovered through their digging efforts."
