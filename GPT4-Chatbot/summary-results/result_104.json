After ingesting it, Peter goes into a frenzy of excited and erratic behavior - running wildly around the room, knocking over furniture and flower pots. His frantic antics culminate in him doing acrobatics and sommersaults before finally leaping out the open window, taking the remaining flower pots with him. Aunt Polly arrives to find the chaos and destruction left behind, completely baffled by Peter's bizarre actions. Tom explains it away by saying cats simply act that way when they're \"having a good time\", leaving Aunt Polly even more perplexed."
