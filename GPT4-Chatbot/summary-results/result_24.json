The boy pictures himself lying sick and dying, with his aunt begging for forgiveness, but he refuses to grant it even on his deathbed.\n\n2. He envisions being brought home dead from the river, with his aunt throwing herself upon him in anguish and regret for mistreating him.\n\n3. These morbid fantasies evoke intense pathos within the boy, causing him to choke back tears and wallow in self-pity.\n\n4. He finds solace in nurturing these sorrowful thoughts and doesn't want any cheerfulness or joy to intrude upon his melancholic state.\n\n5. When his cousin Mary arrives, full of joy and sunshine, the boy retreats into his gloomy thoughts, unwilling to be disrupted from his indulgence in sorrow.\n\nThe passage poignantly captures the depth of the boy's emotional pain and his desire for sympathy and validation, even if it means imagining his own death to evoke remorse from his aunt."
