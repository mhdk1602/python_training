Tom Sawyer was present when the cave door was unlocked, and they found Injun Joe lying dead near the door, seemingly trying to escape until his last moments. Tom felt pity for Injun Joe's suffering but also relief that the threat he posed was over. Injun Joe had attempted to chip away at the door's foundation beam with his bowie knife, but his efforts were futile as the native rock outside formed an impenetrable barrier. Even if he had managed to cut through the beam, his body was too large to squeeze through the narrow opening, indicating the hopelessness of his situation. The passage conveys a sense of finality and closure regarding the menacing presence of Injun Joe."
