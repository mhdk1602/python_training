Tom realizes they must stay put where there is water to drink until rescuers find them. Becky becomes distraught at the prospect of being trapped. Tom tries to reassure her that their absence will be noticed and search parties sent out. However, he makes the mistake of suggesting Becky's mother may not realize she is missing until the next morning after church services, causing Becky more distress. The children anxiously watch their last bit of candle slowly melting away, feeling hopeless as the light diminishes. The passage conveys the growing fear and desperation of the two lost children as their means of light and hope fades in the darkness of the cave."
