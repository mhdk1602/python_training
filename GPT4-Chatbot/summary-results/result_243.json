The Widow Douglas takes charge of caring for the sick Huck, stating he is the Lord's creation and must not be neglected, regardless of whether he is good or bad. She remarks that the Lord marks all his creatures, referring to Huck having some good in him. As morning arrives, weary search parties begin returning to the village, while the strongest citizens continue the extensive search of the cave's unexplored areas. The passage describes lights flitting through the cave's distant passages and the echoes of shoutings and gunshots reverberating through the gloomy cavern corridors. In one remote section, the names \"BECKY AND TOM\" are found inscribed, suggesting a potential discovery related to the missing children."
