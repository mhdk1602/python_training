Tom was relieved when Injun Joe quickly fled without seeing him. Tom reasoned the echoes must have disguised his voice from being recognized by Injun Joe. The terrifying experience left Tom too weak to continue exploring, deciding to stay put at the spring. However, after another long period of hunger, Tom and Becky awoke with raging hunger that overcame their fears. Tom estimated several days had likely passed since being trapped in the cave."
