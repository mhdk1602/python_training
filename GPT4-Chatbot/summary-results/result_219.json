For several nights, their plan is thwarted by clear weather conditions. Finally, on Thursday night with thunderstorms rolling in, the conditions seem ideal. Tom takes his aunt's lantern, wrapping it in a towel, and the two boys sneak toward the tavern. Huck stands watch outside while Tom enters the alley leading to the tavern.
