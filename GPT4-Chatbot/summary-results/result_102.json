The old lady gathers quack periodicals and medicines, believing herself to be an \"angel of healing\" for her suffering neighbors.\n\n2.

When these methods fail to improve Tom's condition, she adds hot baths, oatmeal diets, and blister-plasters.\n\n4. Tom becomes indifferent to the persecution, concerning the old lady, who then decides to try a new quack cure called \"Pain-killer.\"\n\nThe segment highlights the old lady's na\u00efve faith in pseudoscientific treatments and her relentless pursuit of \"curing\" Tom, despite the apparent ineffectiveness and potential harm caused by her methods."
