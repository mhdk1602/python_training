However, Tom soon finds himself intensely desiring to do the very things he has promised not to do. The only thing keeping him from quitting the group is the prospect of wearing the showy \"regalia\" or uniform at public events. Tom pins his hopes on the potential funeral of a local judge, hoping to get a chance to display his Cadet uniform. For three days, Tom eagerly awaits news about the judge's failing health, his desire to wear the regalia outweighing his commitment to the group's principles of temperance."
