Tom tries to explain that he had come to her house at night not to laugh at her troubles, but to reassure her that he and his friend had not drowned. His aunt is skeptical and accuses Tom of lying, as she doesn't believe he could have had such a kind thought. Tom insists he was telling the truth and wanted to prevent her from grieving over their supposed drowning. He reveals he had written a message on bark to tell her they had gone pirating, but held back from giving it to her when she started talking about their funeral, as he didn't want to ruin the idea of hiding in the church. The aunt is torn between wanting to believe Tom's claim of good intentions and finding it unreasonable that he wouldn't have simply told her the truth upfront."
