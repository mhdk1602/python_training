An hour later, Mr. Dobbins prepares to read from a book, causing panic for Tom and Becky. Becky looks terrified, realizing they are about to be caught for really tearing the book's pictures, which Tom had been wrongly punished for. Tom realizes he must act quickly to prevent their misdeed from being exposed, but is paralyzed by the urgency of the situation. The passage builds tension around Tom and Becky's shared secret transgression being on the verge of discovery by the teacher."
