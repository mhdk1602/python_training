Huck waited behind a boulder and soon heard an explosion of gunfire and a cry. He immediately ran away down the hill as fast as he could. The next morning, Huck went to the old Welshman's home and was welcomed in warmly when he knocked. The Welshman and his sons got dressed, and were preparing breakfast for Huck, anticipating he would be hungry after the events of the night before. The passage highlights Huck's fear after the gunshots, his seeking refuge with the friendly Welshman, and their hospitable reception of the vagabond boy despite the dramatic occurrences."
