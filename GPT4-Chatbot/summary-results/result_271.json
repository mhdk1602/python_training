Tom noticed signs like footprints and candle wax around one side of a rock, indicating something was buried there. After some digging, they uncovered boards concealing a natural chasm under the rock. Tom explored the narrow passageway winding under the rock, with Huck following behind. They discovered a small cavern containing the long-sought treasure chest, along with other items like guns, moccasins, and an empty powder keg. The treasure chest was filled with tarnished coins, finally achieving their goal of finding the buried riches."
