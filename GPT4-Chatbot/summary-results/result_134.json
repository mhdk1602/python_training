Tom is hesitant to swim at one point, fearing he has lost the protective charm of his rattlesnake rattles. As they grow bored, the boys start feeling homesick and melancholy. Tom finds himself subconsciously writing \"BECKY\" in the sand, indicating he misses her, though he tries to suppress these feelings. Joe is especially homesick to the point of being nearly overcome with misery. The carefree fun of their adventure has given way to longing for the comforts of home and village life across the river."
