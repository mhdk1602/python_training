The scene is set in a graveyard of an old-fashioned Western kind, located on a hill about a mile and a half from the village.\n\n2. The graveyard is described as dilapidated, with a leaning fence, overgrown grass and weeds, sunken graves, and worm-eaten boards instead of tombstones.\n\n3. The atmosphere is eerie and solemn, with a faint wind moaning through the trees, which Tom fears could be the spirits of the dead complaining about being disturbed.\n\n4. The boys, including Huckleberry Finn with his dead cat, are there for some unknown purpose, and they find a sharp new heap (presumably a fresh grave) and hide within the protection of three elms near the grave.\n\n5. The boys wait in silence for a long time, building up the suspense and mystery surrounding their presence in the graveyard.\n\nThe summary captures the vivid description of the graveyard's eerie and neglected state, the solemn and oppressive atmosphere, and the sense of mystery and suspense surrounding the boys' presence and actions in the graveyard."
