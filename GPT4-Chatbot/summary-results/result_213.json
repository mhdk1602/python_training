Injun Joe considered attacking them with his knife but was interrupted when part of the rotten staircase collapsed under his weight. His companion convinced him that whoever was upstairs likely mistook them for ghosts and fled, so they should leave quickly before nightfall. Injun Joe agreed, and they soon slipped out of the house with their precious box, heading towards the river. Tom and Huck, though greatly relieved, had no intention of following them after their harrowing experience. The segment captures the tense atmosphere and the boys' narrow escape from Injun Joe's clutches."
