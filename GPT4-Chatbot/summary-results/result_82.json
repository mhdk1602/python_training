Doctor Robinson, along with Potter and Injun Joe, are digging up a grave and removing a corpse from the coffin. They place the body on a handbarrow and cover it with a blanket, binding it in place with a rope. Potter demands more money from Doctor Robinson, threatening to leave the body there if he doesn't pay up. Injun Joe backs up Potter's demand. The scene is eerie and sinister, with the moonlight exposing the pallid face of the corpse. The grave robbers seem to be experienced criminals carrying out this grisly act for monetary gain from the doctor."
