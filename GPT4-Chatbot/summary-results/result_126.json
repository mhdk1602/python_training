He gathers some treasures like a dead rat and marbles before cautiously making his way through the woods to the sandbar. Tom then wades and swims across the river current to reach the Illinois side. After coming ashore, he follows the riverbank until he spots the ferryboat near his village. Under cover of night, Tom quietly swims out to the ferryboat and climbs into the skiff attached to it, hiding under the thwarts and waiting while panting from his journey."
