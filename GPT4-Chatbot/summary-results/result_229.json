An ominous owl hooting makes Huck think everything is lost, but then a man clears his throat just a few feet away, startling Huck.\n\n5. The text ends with Huck realizing he is within five steps of something, building suspense and leaving the reader to wonder what he has stumbled upon.\n\nThe summary captures the key events and actions without revealing the full context or resolution, maintaining the tension and mystery of the original passage."
