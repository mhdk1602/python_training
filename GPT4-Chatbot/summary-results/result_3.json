His Aunt Polly, who is raising him, plans to make him work the next day (Saturday) as punishment, even though it's a holiday for other boys. Tom gets home just in time to help Jim, a young Black servant, with chores like sawing wood. Polly tries to slyly question Tom about his day, believing herself to be skilled at cunning interrogation, but she is quite transparent. She asks Tom leading questions implying it was hot at school that day and suggesting he may have wanted to go swimming instead of attending class. The passage portrays Tom as a typical rambunctious boy always looking for adventures, while positioning Aunt Polly as determined but inept at outwitting him."
