They embellished the tale of their adventure until morning. When the sun rose, they went to sleep on the sandbar but got scorched awake. Feeling rusty and homesick after breakfast, Tom tried cheering them up by reminding them of their secret and suggesting they pretend to be Indians instead of pirates. They were attracted to this idea, covering themselves in mud stripes to look like zebra-striped Indian chiefs. They then split into three hostile tribes, ambushing each other with war whoops while killing and scalping one another by the thousands in an exaggeratedly gory imaginary battle. Their day of pretending to be warring Indian tribes was extremely eventful."
