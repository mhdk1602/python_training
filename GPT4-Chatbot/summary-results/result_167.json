Becky tears the page in her attempt to hide it from Tom. She becomes very upset, assuming Tom will tell on her to the teacher Mr. Dobbins and get her whipped as punishment. Tom doesn't intend to tell, thinking getting whipped is no big deal for a girl. He plans to get even with Becky in another way that isn't as mean as telling the teacher. The passage highlights the tension between Tom and Becky, her overreaction and fear of corporal punishment, and Tom's nonchalant attitude viewing it as childish. It sets up a conflict between the two characters over this incident."
