They assemble in camp feeling hungry and happy, but face a dilemma - hostile Native American tribes cannot share hospitality and break bread together without first making peace by smoking a ceremonial peace pipe. Two of the former pirates are initially hesitant about this custom. However, they decide to participate in the pipe smoking ritual, and unexpectedly find enjoyment in learning this new skill of smoking without getting too ill. They spend the evening proudly practicing their new smoking ability, feeling more accomplished than if they had been scalping enemies. The scene portrays their transition and adaptation to Native American customs and way of life after leaving piracy behind."
