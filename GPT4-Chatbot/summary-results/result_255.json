However, their path was blocked by a deep pitfall that they could not cross. Despite Tom's efforts to signal the searchers, the sounds grew fainter until they disappeared completely, leaving the children trapped. Despondent, they returned to the spring. With no sign of rescue, Tom decided to explore some nearby side passages, using a kite-line to avoid getting lost. The passage ended after 20 steps at what seemed to be a drop-off. Though initially hopeful, their situation remained precarious as they were still lost and awaiting rescue deep underground."
