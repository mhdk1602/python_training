The preacher delivers a moving sermon recounting the boys' past misbehaviors, causing the entire congregation to break down in tears. However, the somber moment is shattered when the three \"dead\" boys unexpectedly march into the church. Tom leads the way, followed by Joe and a sheepish, ragged Huck sneaking in the rear. \n\nThe boys had been hiding in the gallery, listening to their own funeral sermon. Their families are overcome with joy at their return, smothering them with kisses and thanksgivings. However, Huck feels abashed and uncomfortable amidst the warm welcomes, unsure how to react. Tom intervenes, insisting that someone should be glad to see Huck as well, highlighting the lack of a caring family to receive the orphaned boy."
