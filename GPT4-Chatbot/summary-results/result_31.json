School lasted from 9:00-10:30am, followed by a church service. Some children voluntarily stayed for the sermon, while others remained for other implied reasons. The plain church building could seat around 300 people. Before entering, Tom trades various trinkets with other boys to obtain different colored tickets, suggesting some kind of game or activity. Once inside, Tom misbehaves by starting quarrels, pulling hair, sticking pins in other boys, and getting reprimanded by the teacher, highlighting his mischievous behavior during the church service. Despite the brevity of the passage, it vividly captures the atmosphere of a 19th century small town Sunday school class through rich descriptive details."
