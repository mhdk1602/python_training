    "analysis_result": "Here is a concise summary of the key points from the given text segment:\n\nThe passage describes the aftermath of the grave robbery incident involving Injun Joe and the murder of Dr. Robinson. Inquests ceased as they were no longer helpful for easing Tom's guilty conscience. Tom would smuggle small comforts to Injun Joe in jail to help alleviate his own guilt. The villagers wanted to tar-and-feather Injun Joe for body-snatching, but no one was willing to lead the effort due to his formidable character. The court case was dropped as Injun Joe did not confess to the initial grave robbery preceding the murder during his statements. A new issue arose as Becky Thatcher stopped coming to school, distracting Tom from his secret troubles as he began spending time near her father's house at night, unable to get over his pride and feelings for her."
