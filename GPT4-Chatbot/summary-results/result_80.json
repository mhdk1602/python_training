They whisper to each other, discussing whether the dead can hear them and worrying about disturbing the spirit of \"Hoss Williams.\" Their conversation is filled with superstitious dread about angering the souls of the deceased. When they hear an unsettling noise, they cling to each other in fear, terrified that ghosts or spirits are coming for them. Tom tries to reassure Huck that they'll be safe if they remain still and don't bother the spirits, but Huck is \"all of a shiver\" from fright. The passage captures the boyish fear and imagination when confronted with the unknown in a graveyard setting."
