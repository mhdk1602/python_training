The cavern contained a spring with crystallized frost, supported by fantastical pillars formed over centuries by stalactites and stalagmites. Disturbed by their lights, thousands of bats swarmed down, forcing the children to flee deeper into the cavern passages to escape them. Tom eventually discovered an underground lake stretching out into the shadows. As they rested, the deep stillness made the children realize how long it had been since they heard the voices of the others in their group, raising a sense of unease about being lost and alone underground."
