He explains how he explored different avenues using his kite-line until he glimpsed a distant speck of daylight. Following that light led him to a small hole opening to the Mississippi River. He then went back for Becky, who had resigned herself to dying in the cave. Tom convinced the despairing Becky to follow him, and she was overcome with joy when she too saw the daylight and they were able to exit the cave to safety. The tale highlights Tom's perseverance in exploring the cave passages thoroughly until he found a way out, as well as his determination to not leave Becky behind despite her giving up hope."
