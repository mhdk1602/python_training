Becky is satisfied with Tom's artistic skills. Tom then draws a crude figure meant to represent Becky herself. Becky wishes she could draw as well. Tom offers to teach her at noon if she stays instead of going home for dinner. They introduce themselves to each other. Tom begins writing something secretive on the slate, piquing Becky's curiosity. When she pleads to see what he's written, Tom is hesitant but Becky promises not to tell anyone else what it says."
