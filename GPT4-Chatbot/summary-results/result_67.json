Tom explains to Becky the concept of being \"engaged\" - professing exclusive love to someone and sealing it with a kiss. Becky is naive and curious about these romantic notions. Tom tries to get Becky to reveal what he had written for her on the slate previously, something presumably of a romantic nature. After some hesitation, Becky agrees to whisper it back to Tom if he turns away, making him promise not to tell anyone else. The passage captures the innocence and wonder of childhood as the two friends navigate the new feelings of puppy love and intimacy through whispered secrets and promises."
