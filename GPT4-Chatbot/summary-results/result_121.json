They spend the day tramping through the woods, swimming, and reveling in the natural surroundings. The island provides plenty to delight them, with its decaying logs, tangled underbrush, towering trees draped in vines, and grassy nooks with flowers. \n\nAfter returning to camp hungry in the afternoon, they eat cold ham and then rest in the shade. However, the stillness and solemnity of the woods soon starts to weigh on their spirits. A sense of loneliness and undefined longing creeps over them - the beginnings of homesickness, even for Finn who is portrayed as adventurous. The vivid descriptions capture the carefree exploration turning wistful as the reality of their isolation sets in."
