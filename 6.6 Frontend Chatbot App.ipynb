You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. The advantages of international mobility and a second country where one could live and work has gained much prominence over the years. While immigration and citizenship laws across countries have become friendlier (check out our article on 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World), acquiring citizenship or permanent residency requires substantial time-- other than for direct citizenship by investment programs-- and energy. However, another way to live and work in a country can be easily obtained through a residence permit.Residence Permit: An OverviewA residence permit is basically a document that provides the holder a right to live in a specific country for a specific period of time. The residence permit allows one to live, buy property, cross border, do business, take advantage of medical facilities, and enroll in educational institutions, among others. There are multiple ways of getting a residence permit, which includes marriage, work, study, or investment. The need for international diversification in terms of both human force and foreign direct investment has propelled countries to recognize the need for making special provisions for investors, businessmen and highly qualified and skilled individuals.It is thus, no wonder that the issuance of residence permit have registered an increase over the years. In European Union countries, for instance, 3.7 million first residence permits were issued in 2022 to non-EU citizens, a 26% increase (+753445 permit) from 2021. While there are various ways to obtain a residence permit -- with \\u201cEmployment Reasons\\u201d taking the larger share (42%) of all first residence permits for EU countries in 2021 -- the investment route (Golden Visa) is by far the easier and quicker option.The global demand for investor visas have sustained an upward trend with more than 165,000 people opting for them from the US, UK, Canada, and EU countries during the years 2008-2022. One of the popular investor visas include the US EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program that has been operating for more than 30 years. From 2010-2019, the US approved 81,125 investor visas, which is higher than the combined visas issued by Canada, UK, and Portugal. A rise in the trend for European Golden Visas have also been noted. Greece, for example, recorded a 63% increase in the demand for their residence permit programs\\u2014from January to May 2023, 3,900 Golden Visa applications had been submitted as compared to 1,444 in 2022. Canada, through their Start-Up Visa, also allowed 175 new permanent residents in August, 2023, a 29.6% increase from July, 2023.Story continuesDeveloped Countries: A Prosperous Investment AvenueDeveloped countries like the US, Canada and EU states have prosperous economies that foster investment. America is the world\\u2019s largest national economy and a global leader in trade. Home to some of the top companies in the world like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc., the US investment environment is bound to attract investors and entrepreneurs. Other regions around the world, like Europe, can also boast of growing economies. With a population of about 743.5 million in 2022, twice that of the US, Europe is home to not just a large number of people but also hosts some of the largest economies in the world. Germany, for example had a GDP of $4.26 trillion in 2021, fourth worldwide with regard to nominal GDP. The 27 country European Union economic block accounts for about 14% of the world\\u2019s total trade in goods. The total value of goods and services produced in the region also amounted to \\u20ac14.5 trillion in 2021. Given such statistics, the proliferation of many top-notch multinational companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc. into the area is not surprising.Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), for instance, just recently cemented their European AI investments by announcing a \\u20ac25M (US$26.98m) investment that is geared towards improvement in AI skills across the region. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) on the other hand, invested an additional \\u20ac1 billion to expand Silicon Design Centre, earlier last year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), has also made a recent commitment to expand their cloud infrastructure to meet the demand in Europe.Let's now head over to the list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit.16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence PermitMethodologyIn order to compile our list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit, we base our method on residence permit received by investment as the easiest way. For this we first select Residency Programs being offered and then pick out the popular or leading Residency by Investment Programs by scouring web as well as our article. We then look at their minimum cost and application processing time and rank them according to the lowest cost and shortest time period. We take a weighted average for the two metrics, with a higher weight (0.6) allotted to cost and the lower to time (0.4). We present our list in a descending order of rank.Note: The figures for the approximate US Dollar amounts are based on the current exchange rate and are therefore subject to change.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

MaltaMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 7Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 22Insider Monkey weighted Average: 13One of the popular countries for investor looking to either gain a residency or citizenship, Malta is also one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. An economically and politically sound country, the country has much to offer investors. The high quality of life to tax advantages, all have contributed to the country\\u2019s popularity for residency and investment schemes. According to the requirements of the program, the investor must have at least \\u20ac500,000 (approximately US $545,000) worth of assets, \\u20ac150,000 (approximately US $163,500) of which should be invested in liquid financial assets. In addition, other stipulations of the program demand property acquisition or lease as well as economic contribution to Maltese economy and donation to a non-governmental organization. Permanent residency is obtained immediately after the application process is complete, which takes about 6-8 months.15. Costa RicaMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 6Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 23Insider Monkey weighted Average: 12.8Costa Rica is yet another of the countries that provides easy access to residence permit. With only a US $150,000 investment-- in either property or business -- under the Investor Visa Program, one can find a way to settle down in the country. Forestry projects, however, requires only $100,000 investment. The initial residence permit issued is for two years which is then also renewable, provided the investor maintains the investment. The application process time is a bit higher than other programs, taking about 9 months.14.

CanadaMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 1Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 26Insider Monkey weighted Average: 11Canada\\u2019s Start-Up Visa Program is not only the best Golden Visa program that has been attracted many an investors, but is also one of the easiest for getting a residence permit. This is primarily due to the non-existent cost of the program. Here the applicant is not required to make an investment themselves but can provide backing of accredited external investors. A C$200,000 (approximately US $148,000) commitment from a designated Canadian venture capital funds, a C$75,000 (approximately US $55,500) commitment from part of a designated Canadian angel investor groups, or a confirmation that the start-up is part of a designated Canadian business incubator program are the different options available. The application process time however, is somewhat higher in comparison to other applications.11.

Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invesco predicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.During economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanley suggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.Story continuesAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \\\"stockpicker's market.\\\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \\\"Magnificent 7\\\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\\u00a0\\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\\u2019s the main message for investors, is \\u2018find growth.\\u2019\\u201dSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value.

      "            \"Content\": \"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "            \"Content\": \"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the\\u00a014 Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.\\u00a0For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5\\u00a0Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.When the generative AI boom started, investing circles brushed aside the possibility of AI picking stocks for humans to maximize returns. It\\u2019s too complex and subjective a job for any AI model, they said. Fast forward a few months, more and more investment experts and firms are deploying AI for stock picking. Bloomberg in February reported that Vanguard Group was using AI in several of its products that use quant investing techniques. Among the funds where Vanguard has deployed machine learning models include the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund, the Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. The Bloomberg report said that the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund and the Strategic Small-Cap Fund beat their benchmarks and outperformed industry peers last year.Machine learning and algorithms have long been at play in the investing game for quant funds. But the generative AI boom is making the power of mathematical, AI-powered analysis available for everyone. Using AI in investing would no longer be limited to quant funds. Financial services company Mercer conducted a survey to find out the penetration of AI among investment managers across its Global Investment Manager Database. Nine out of 10 surveyed managers said they are already using or planning to use AI in their investment process. A whopping 54% of the investment managers said they are already using AI to assist their decision making, while 37% plan to use the technology in the near future.Mercer said in its report that the investment managers it surveyed said that the use of AI would give a whopping $14 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.Since generative AI and machine learning in investing is currently in its early stages, there are some challenges for investment managers who are trying to use the technology to their advantage. Data quality and data availability are among the biggest challenges these managers are facing.Story continuesHumans VS Robots in the Stock-Picking GameBut robots are not taking over the investing game (for now). Almost no one in the survey said they are completely outsourcing the investing-related decision-making to AI. They are using AI-powered models just for assistance, idea generation, data analysis and other important tasks in the investing process. Final decision-making still rests with humans. The report added:\\u201cJust a small minority of managers report fully automated statistical, ML and DL models, reinforcing AI and ML technologies as tools that support managers, rather than replacing the role of manager judgment and intervention. Among managers currently using AI, around one in 10 report full automation of statistical models (11%), ML (14%) and DL models (6%), while a third report infrequent monitoring of these processes (33%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Across all three areas, a significant proportion of current AI processes remain reliant on constant human intervention, reinforcing the role of AI and ML technologies as a supportive \\u201ctool\\u201d rather than a direct replacement of humans across the investment process.\\u201dBest Stocks To Buy According to AIMethodologyThis article is a performance evaluation of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year. We wanted to see whether ChatGPT is any good at stock picking. For that we reverted to our experiment with ChatGPT conducted in March 2023 where we asked ChatGPT to recommend some stocks that would make one rich over the next 10 years. We also consulted Finder.com\\u2019s experiment with AI in which researchers at the comparison website asked ChatGPT to create a \\u201cportfolio of stocks from high-quality businesses with criteria taken from the leading 10 funds it is competing against.\\u201d This portfolio was also created back in March 2023.\\u00a0 In this article we picked 14 stocks from these two ChatGPT-recommended portfolios with the highest number of hedge fund investors. With each stock we mentioned its performance since the date it was picked up by ChatGPT. The idea is to assess the performance of ChatGPT when it comes to stock picking.ChatGPT Stock Picks: Performance Overview After One Year14.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +6%Benzinga\\u00a0asked ChatGPT to make a stock portfolio to beat the leading equity funds in the US backed in May 2023. Tesla\\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\u00a0was one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT at the time. Since then through March 27, 2024, Tesla\\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\u00a0shares have gained just 6% as Tesla\\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\u00a0continues to battle growth issues amid a slowdown in EV demand.Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\\u201cTesla, Inc.\\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla\\u2019s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company\\u2019s full self-driving capabilities.\\u201d12. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +11%Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have gained about 11% since March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended the stock to Insider Monkey\\u2019s researchers when they asked the chatbot to suggest stocks that have the potential to make one rich. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been late to the AI game and perhaps that\\u2019s why its stock gains aren\\u2019t that impressive. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) business in China is also facing challenges. Analysts expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reveal its AI projects in the upcoming developer conference scheduled for June.Orbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc.

After two years of strong pricing growth, the company is facing slower market growth in both the US and Europe. China, the company\\u2019s second largest individual market, is facing a protracted downturn with poor visibility on when fundamentals will improve.\\u201d10. Visa Inc (NYSE:V)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +28%On March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended Visa Inc (NYSE:V) to Insider Monkey, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) shares were trading at around $223, while the stock price sits at $279 today. This shows a 28% gain in stock price.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa\\u00a0Inc (NYSE:V).In its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):\\u201cVisa Inc.\\u00a0(NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33. As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we\\u2019re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa\\u2019s outlook.\\u201d9. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +29%When finder.com asked ChatGPT to make a market-beating stock portfolio back in March 2023, the LLM included Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) in the list of its stock recommendations. Since March 6, 2023, through date Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) shares have gained about 29%.8. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +42%Insider Monkey asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to make a stock portfolio that'd make one rich in the next ten years. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B) was part of the stocks recommended by the large language model. It proved to be one of the best stocks to buy according to AI because since March 16, 2023, the stock has gained about 42%.7. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +53%Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT to finder.com when the website asked the chatbot in March 2023 to make a portfolio. Since then through March 27, 2024, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares have gained about 53%. Adobe announced a host of new AI-related products at its annual Summit event recently.Here is what\\u00a0Polen Global Growth\\u00a0has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\\u201cBoth Alphabet and Adobe\\u2019s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to\\u00a0Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.\\u201d6. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +65%Alphabet Inc Class C\\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\\u00a0is one of the best stocks to buy according to AI. Alphabet Inc Class C\\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\\u00a0was recommended by ChatGPT to Insider Monkey when our researchers asked the chatbot to make a market-beating portfolio back in March 2023. Since then through March 27, 2024, Alphabet Inc Class C\\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\\u00a0shares have gained about 65% in value.Wedbush Securities recently added Alphabet Inc Class C\\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\\u00a0to its Best Ideas list and said the \\u201cperceived\\u201d risks to Google Search are overblown and Alphabet Inc Class C\\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\\u00a0remains a \\u201cnet beneficiary\\u201d of generative AI.Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google\\u2019s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis\\u2026\\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\\u00a0Click to continue reading and see\\u00a05\\u00a0Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.

      "            \"Content\": \"The \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" has driven most of the stock market gains since the beginning of 2023, but each stock is starting to show cracks in its armor. Some of them have gotten far too extended and trade for unreasonable valuations despite the success in their underlying businesses. But are all of them overvalued?Let's examine this group and see if any could be considered cheap or if you'll need to pay a hefty premium to own these seven stocks.The Magnificent Seven aren't all dominating as they did in 2023The Magnificent Seven is made up of the following companies:Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)2023 was a phenomenal year for this cohort, with the worst-performing stock (Apple) returning nearly 50%. However, 2024 hasn't been so kind, and each stock's performance has been all over the place.MSFT data by YCharts.Part of this dichotomy has been valuation, as investors aren't willing to pay up to own some of the stocks in the Magnificent Seven.Because the Magnificent Seven are mostly considered growth companies, I'll use their revenue growth combined with their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to assess their valuation; I believe these two metrics show a wider picture. Cost reduction measures can prop up earnings, but those can only grow earnings for so long without any top-line growth.Tesla has had the worst year, losing nearly a third of its value this year. Its declining market value can be attributed to slowing growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales and shrinking margins due to rising competition. The really high premium that investors were willing to pay for the stock tumbled, and now the stock trades for 55 times forward earnings.Apple is in a similar situation, but its problems have occurred for much longer. Throughout 2023, Apple's quarterly revenue either shrank or grew at a 2% pace on a year-on-year basis. That's not great for a company valued like a growth stock, so it is no surprise that investors aren't willing to pay as much of a premium. Even at its current 26 times forward earnings, the stock still looks pricey for its growth.Story continuesBesides these two, the rest are up in 2024, but that doesn't mean they are all overpriced.The remaining five have varying situationsAlphabet and Meta Platforms come to the top of the list for stocks that I believe aren't overpriced. Alphabet, Google's parent company, has had some public relations issues related to the rollout of its generative AI model. However, Alphabet's ad business is still doing well, and with the company trading at 22 times forward earnings, it's the cheapest on the list.Meta isn't much more expensive, with the stock trading at 25.5 times forward earnings. Since its primary business is advertising (through its various social media platforms), it's benefiting from the same ad recovery wave as Alphabet. As a result, it's primed to continue growing for some time.Nvidia isn't as expensive as some may expect, as its vast growth hasn't concluded yet. At 38 times forward earnings, it's quite pricey, but with Nvidia being at the center of the AI revolution with its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), it's to be expected.Amazon is more difficult to assess. It's still optimizing its business for profits, so its forward earnings multiple is skewed and will likely remain that way for some time. At 42 times earnings, it's the second-most expensive on the list. However, with Amazon's rising gross profit margin, it will only be a matter of time before its profits rocket higher and its valuation looks more reasonable.AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.Lastly, Microsoft is one of the most expensive stocks on this list despite being the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Microsoft's valuation is an incredibly pricey 37 times forward earnings -- nearly as expensive as Nvidia's despite far less growth. It earned this premium through fantastic AI product rollout and increased cloud computing market share. However, 37 times earnings is a lot for a company growing at 18% that appears to be fully optimized for profits.So, with all that information, how do these stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive?Valuation rankingsRanking the stocks by their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple alone doesn't tell the full picture, as companies like Apple are struggling to grow while Nvidia is tripling its revenue. These rankings won't solely be based on metrics; they'll also include a nod to current growth and future opportunities.With that in mind, here are my rankings of the Magnificent Seven from the cheapest to most expensive:AlphabetMeta PlatformsAmazonNvidiaTeslaMicrosoftAppleRanking Alphabet and Meta as the cheapest was a no-brainer, but I'm also convinced that Amazon and Nvidia have more room to grow, making their expensive valuations seem cheaper in the grand scheme of things. Tesla is hard to figure out, but if EV demand continues to rise, this may be a bargain price. Lastly, Microsoft and Apple are very expensive for their growth, with Apple being the worst offender because it's hardly growing.Although this is my ranking, investors should decide for themselves whether any of these stocks are \\\"cheap\\\" enough to buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\\u2019t one of them.

      "            \"Content\": \"The S&P 500 roared higher over the past year or so from its bear market low to a new all-time high -- and this movement confirmed the market has indeed shifted into bull territory. The gains weren't exactly broad-based though. Stocks dubbed the \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- drove gains as they soared in the double or triple digits last year.Of course, that's just a short-term increase. But these stocks have proven themselves over a longer period too. Let's take a look at the performance of each of these players over the past five years and see if they still represent compelling buy stories. Here they are, ranked from best to worst, according to performance.Image source: Getty Images.1. Nvidia, up 1,950%Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and share price growth truly took off thanks to its crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used to be best known for their role in gaming -- but the ability to rapidly process many tasks simultaneously made Nvidia's GPUs a perfect fit for AI.Today, Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI chip market, and that's not likely to change as the company invests heavily to stay ahead of rivals. This tech giant just recently announced its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips ever, set for release later this year.2. Tesla, up 881%Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings and share price performance actually have slowed in recent times as various factors weigh on the electric vehicle giant -- from higher costs linked to production ramp-ups to negative foreign exchange impact.But Tesla surged over the past five years as the company delivered more and more vehicles, opened major new factories, delivered record earnings, and built up more than $29 billion in cash. The cash level is particularly important because it will help this ambitious EV leader continue to innovate and potentially progress on programs such as self-driving technology.Story continuesSo, Tesla's slowdown looks like a temporary situation, meaning growth probably isn't over for this market giant.3. Apple, up 268%Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) brand strength has helped it keep users coming back to world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac -- and even continue to attract new customers. This has made Apple the go-to stock for the technology investor seeking growth and safety. The company even won over billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has almost half of his portfolio invested in the tech giant.Some may worry that Apple's growth could plateau at a certain point, but one particular thing makes me confident that won't happen. The company's services -- sold to its growing user base -- have taken off, with services revenue reaching records. And this could drive a whole new era of growth for Apple.4. Microsoft, up 260%Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), like Apple, is a classic tech company that's proven its strength over the long haul. But in recent times, Microsoft also has shown its ability to seize a growth opportunity. The company was an early believer in AI, investing $1 billion in OpenAI, the developer of chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019.The tech powerhouse later extended the partnership and increased its investment, a move that also strengthened the company's cloud business, Azure. This business offers a wide variety of AI tools and has seen its revenue growth soar, rising 30% in the most recent period -- surpassing that of rivals Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Their revenue advanced 13% and 26%, respectively.So, Microsoft clearly could be a winner in the potential AI revolution.5. Meta Platforms, up 197%Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) went through a period of cost cutting in recent times, but at the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned for the next step for this social media giant. And that's building up strengths in AI. The company has gone all in on that, developing its own large language model and aiming to apply AI across its products and services.On top of that, Meta's dominance in social media is unwavering, a key point since it, through advertising, brings in most of the company's revenue. It's easy to imagine AI further boosting the company's social media platforms and driving more growth.6. Alphabet, up 159%Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has an extremely solid moat, or competitive advantage, in the business that brings in the lion's share of its revenue. And that's Google Search, which holds more than 90% of the global search market. This has kept advertisers coming back, even during recent times of higher inflation.Today, Alphabet, like many of these Magnificent Seven companies, is investing in AI, and this technology is helping it to make search faster and better. This, along with AI offerings through Google Cloud, may power earnings growth in the coming years.7. Amazon, up 103%Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed during the early days of the pandemic as customers flocked to e-commerce -- but a couple of years later, higher inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and the wallets of its customers. And that hurt stock performance, making Amazon the worst-performing of the Magnificent Seven over the past five years (though a 100% gain isn't something to frown about).But the company revamped its cost structure\\u00a0and shifted from an annual loss in 2022 to solid profit in 2023, and the shares went on to gain. And this may continue thanks to Amazon's focus on AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its own operations and selling AI products and services through AWS, the world's cloud services leader.Are the Magnificent Seven stocks buys today?Now, let's get back to our question: Do these high-flying stocks still represent compelling buys? As you can see in the chart, they remain reasonably priced in relation to forward earnings estimates if you consider the long-term growth prospects of each of these players.AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) ChartTesla is the most expensive by this measure, but these figures consider potential earnings next year -- which is rather short term. The EV giant's moves today to lower the costs of producing its vehicles and incorporate AI in its processes could pay off over the coming years, making today's valuation look fair. Still, other players like Alphabet or Meta clearly are cheap and may represent an even better buying opportunity right now.And here's one important thing to note: Some of these companies went through rough patches in recent times, yet they still managed to deliver big gains over a five-year period. This is a great example of the power of long-term investing, which implies holding on to a stock for at least five years.All of this means it's not too late to get in on some or all of the Magnificent Seven, a group of quality stocks that could continue to deliver top returns over the long haul.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\\u2019t one of them.

      "            \"Content\": \"For nearly 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling professional and everyday investors with outsize investment returns. Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 34,000%, including dividends paid, since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares have appreciated by more than 5,000,000%.Buffett and his investment team have long relied on brand-name, time-tested, and well-managed businesses to deliver superior returns. But it's Buffett's preference for dividend stocks that might provide one of the biggest boosts to Berkshire's long-term outperformance.According to a report issued last year by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have produced an average annual return of 9.18% over a half-century (1973-2022). This compares to a modest 3.95% average annual return for public companies that don't offer a payout.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.Companies that regularly share a percentage of their earnings with their investors are almost always time-tested and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. This is why Berkshire Hathaway's $370 billion investment portfolio is packed with dozens of dividend stocks.But diversification was never big with Buffett or his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger. Although the investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee is on pace to generate about $6 billion in annual dividend income, a whopping $4.36 billion in combined common- and preferred-stock dividends can be traced to just five companies.Bank of America: $991.5 million in annual dividend incomeBerkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding by market value ($38 billion), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is the Buffett's dividend breadwinner. The more than 1 billion shares of BofA Berkshire owns will yield almost $992 million in annual dividend income.The reason Buffett has long favored financial stocks (especially banks) is because they benefit from disproportionately long periods of U.S. growth. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the U.S. economic cycle, they have all been short-lived since the end of World War II.Story continuesBy comparison, there have been two expansions that surpassed the decade mark. Cyclical bank stocks like Bank of America are able to steadily increase their interest income and fee-generating loan portfolios as the U.S. economy expands.The other well-defined lure for Bank of America is that it's the most interest-sensitive money-center bank in the United States. This is to say that its net-interest income will increase or decrease more with changes to the prevailing interest rate than with other big banks. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle during the past two years has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to Bank of America's bottom line.Occidental Petroleum: $897.5 million in annual dividend incomeThe second-biggest dividend payer in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio might come as a bit of a surprise. Energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which doesn't have a particularly hefty yield, is on pace to provide more than $897 million in aggregate annual income this year.Based on the roughly 248 million shares of Occidental common stock that Berkshire has acquired since the start of 2022, Buffett's company should collect more than $218 million in dividend income this year. But Berkshire also owns $8.49 billion in preferred stock in Occidental that yields 8% annually ($679.2 million a year). This was originally a $10 billion stake, but Occidental has since redeemed $1.51 billion of the issue.The reason Occidental Petroleum is so attractive to Buffett and his crew likely is because it's more linked than other integrated oil and gas companies to the spot price of crude oil. It generates the bulk of its sales from its drilling operations.More than three years of reduced capital investment from major energy companies during the pandemic has constrained global oil supply and provided a lift to the spot price of crude. If prices remain elevated, Occidental should enjoy an outsized benefit.Image source: Apple.Apple: $869.3 million in annual dividend incomeIt's probably no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by market value ($154.7 billion), tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), is one of the biggest providers of dividend income. Even after Buffett and his aides pared down Berkshire's Apple stake by some 10 million shares during the fourth quarter, the nearly 905.6 million shares still held will generate about $869 million in annual dividend income.The beauty of Apple stock has long been its exceptional branding, strong customer loyalty, and top-tier innovation. Though it remains the domestic leader in smartphone market share, much of the future growth is expected to come from its shift to services.CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a steady push toward subscriptions, which should smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur just before major iPhone upgrade cycles, as well as keep customers loyal to Apple's ecosystem of products and services.But if you ask Buffett, his favorite thing about Apple might be its market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it has repurchased almost $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only is this providing a boost to Apple's earnings per share, but it is also steadily increasing Berkshire Hathaway's ownership stake in the company without having to do a thing.Chevron: $822.1 million in annual dividend incomeOil stocks are historically known for their robust payouts. In addition to collecting over $897 million from Occidental Petroleum, Buffett's company should be on the receiving end of more than $822 million in annual payouts from Chevron (NYSE: CVX). The dividend hike Chevron announced in February marked the 37th consecutive year it has lifted its base annual payout.Even though Chevron and Occidental are subject to the same macro forces, Chevron's outlook is a bit different than Occidental. That's because Chevron's revenue channels are skewed more toward its non-drilling assets, such as pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. These midstream and downstream assets produce highly predictable cash flow in virtually any economy.Chevron also has what can be considered one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies. It closed out 2023 with a net debt ratio of just 7.3%. Given its storied history of generating positive cash flow from its operations, Chevron has the financial flexibility to make big acquisitions and return a lot of money to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.Coca-Cola: $776 million in annual dividend incomeThe fifth dividend stock that -- along with Bank of America, Occidental, Apple, and Chevron -- is helping Warren Buffett and his team oversee the collection of $4.36 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is consumer staples titan Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).Coca-Cola has been a continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway since 1988. Because the cost basis on the 400 million shares held by Berkshire is so low (about $3.2475 per share), Coke's $1.94-per-share annual payout equates to a nearly 60% yield on cost for Buffett's company.What's made Coca-Cola stock such a wonderful investment for decades is its geographic diversity. It has operations in every country worldwide with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia. This means it's able to take advantage of faster organic growth in emerging markets, while still generating highly predictable operating cash flow in developed countries. It also has more than two dozen brands that generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales.Top-shelf marketing is another reason Coca-Cola has been able to increase its annual dividend in each of the past 62 years. It's leaning on digital media channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor advertisements for younger audiences, and can rely on its well-known brand ambassadors and rich history to connect with more-mature consumers.Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Bank of America wasn\\u2019t one of them.

    "# Enhancing the Stock Trading Platform with Real-time Data and Interactive Features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps outlines the significant updates implemented in our stock trading platform. The improvements include real-time stock price data integration, news article aggregation related to individual stocks, and a chatbot feature which simulates responses from Warren Buffet, utilizing Anthropic's Claude model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Real-time Stock Price Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "To provide users with the most current stock prices, we implemented a feature that fetches real-time stock data from the `yfinance` library. This data is then displayed on the user interface, enhancing the user experience by offering the most recent stock market information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In the Flask backend (`app.py`), we set up an API endpoint to obtain the latest stock prices from the `yfinance` library. Here is a snippet of the Python function that fetches the stock prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_intraday_price(symbol, interval='1m'):\n",
    "    ticker = yf.Ticker(symbol)\n",
    "    intraday_data = ticker.history(period=\"1d\", interval=interval)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the frontend (`index.tsx`), a React `useEffect` hook was used to call the Flask API at regular intervals to update the stock prices displayed on the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    const fetchPrices = async () => {\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        await Promise.all(fetchPricePromises);\n",
    "        setStockPrices(prices);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    fetchPrices();\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}, [stocksData]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: News Article Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "To aid users in making informed decisions, we added a feature that aggregates recent news articles pertaining to specific stocks. This feature scrapes news data from Yahoo Finance and stores it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "The aggregation process involves utilizing the `yfinance` library to extract news URLs, followed by using `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the content of these articles. This data is then stored locally in JSON files, which are updated daily. Here is a snippet demonstrating how news articles are aggregated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_news(stock_list):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    for stock in stock_list:\n",
    "        ticker = yf.Ticker(stock)\n",
    "        news_data = ticker.news\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        response = requests.get(link, headers=headers)\n",
    "        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Storing Articles in JSON and PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "After the news articles are aggregated, they are stored in JSON files. These articles are also stored in a PostgreSQL database, allowing for structured storage and efficient retrieval of the news data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In the Flask application, a routine is established to read the stored JSON files and populate the PostgreSQL database with the news data. This ensures that the latest news articles are readily available for retrieval. Here is a snippet showcasing the storage and retrieval process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def insert_news_to_db():\n",
    "    news_dir = 'news'\n",
    "    for file_name in os.listdir(news_dir):\n",
    "        if file_name.endswith('.json'):\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "            with open(os.path.join(news_dir, file_name)) as f:\n",
    "                news_data = json.load(f)\n",
    "                ...\n",
    "                new_entry = News(ticker=ticker, news=news_text, as_of_date=as_of_date)\n",
    "                db.session.add(new_entry)\n",
    "                db.session.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of the steps so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set up a reliable data pipeline, we are now equipped with a rich reservoir of real-time data. This not only serves as a robust back-end support for our trading platform but also paves the way for sophisticated features, such as the interactive chatbot. The essence of this phase is to harness the potential of real-time data, enhancing the analytical depth and user engagement of the platform. Now, we transition into leveraging this data to fuel an interactive chatbot feature, aiming to simulate insightful responses for user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Implementing the Chatbot Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "To escalate user engagement and provide insightful interactions, we introduced a chatbot feature that simulates responses from Warren Buffet, facilitated by Anthropic's Claude model. This section also illustrates how a similar goal can be achieved using OpenAI's GPT-4, emphasizing the flexible approach to integrating AI models for interactive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "The Flask backend, upon receiving the user's question, identifies the stock ticker mentioned in the query and aggregates the recent news about the stock. This aggregated data, combined with the user's question, forms a comprehensive prompt for the Claude model, which then generates a thoughtful response. Below is a snippet illustrating the Flask endpoint and the method of invoking the Anthropic API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/ask_warren', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def ask_warren():\n",
    "    user_question = request.json.get('userQuestion')\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    response = client.messages.create(\n",
    "        model=\"YOUR_MODEL_NAME\",\n",
    "        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": base_prompt}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}],\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"response\": response_content})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a similar approach can be applied with OpenAI's GPT-4. For instance, you can construct a prompt with metadata and user questions to generate responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key-here'\n",
    "\n",
    "response = openai.Completion.create(\n",
    "  engine=\"gpt-4\",\n",
    "  prompt=f\"Stock Ticker: {ticker}\\nRecent News: {ticker_news}\\nUser Question: {user_question}\\n\",\n",
    "  temperature=0.7,\n",
    "  max_tokens=150\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the frontend, we established a chat interface that promotes a fluid interaction with the chatbot, rendering the conversation in a user-friendly format. The interaction with the Flask backend is facilitated through HTTP requests, as demonstrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const handleQuestionSubmit = async () => {\n",
    "    const response = await fetch(\"http://localhost:5002/ask_warren\", {\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    });\n",
    "    const data = await response.json();\n",
    "    setChatHistory([...chatHistory, { role: \"user\", content: userQuestion }, { role: \"warren\", content: data.response }]);\n",
    "    setUserQuestion(\"\");\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting these strategies, the stock trading platform is now fortified with features that not only offer users real-time stock data and the latest news articles on particular stocks but also facilitate interactive dialogues with a chatbot, enhancing the overall user experience and equipping users with valuable insights for making informed trading decisions."
