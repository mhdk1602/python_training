    "Data modeling is a critical aspect of data engineering, where a data model is created to represent the data and its relationships. It involves defining the data structure, data types, and relationships between the data entities. The goal of data modeling is to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and meaningful.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In data engineering, data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual, logical, and physical model of the data. Here are the three main types of data models:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Conceptual Data Model:</b> The conceptual data model is the first step in the data modeling process. It defines the high-level view of the data, without going into much detail. The conceptual model identifies the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Logical Data Model:</b> The logical data model is a more detailed view of the data, where the focus is on the structure and relationships between the entities. The logical model defines the tables, columns, keys, and relationships between them.<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Physical Data Model:</b> The physical data model is a representation of the logical data model in the form of a database schema. It defines the actual structure of the database, including data types, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "Data modeling is an iterative process, and it involves collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure that the model meets the requirements. The data model must be flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain, as the data may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A physical data model is the actual manifestation of the entity and relationship in code.\n",
