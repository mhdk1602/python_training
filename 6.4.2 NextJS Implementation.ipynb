    "# Building a Stock Trading Platform with GraphQL, PostGraphile, and Next.js\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to showcase advanced data engineering techniques by integrating a front-end application developed with Next.js with a backend PostgreSQL database using GraphQL and PostGraphile. Here we outline the main objectives and the changes implemented in the docker-compose file and the initialization of the react app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Showcasing GraphQL Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Using PostGraphile and GraphiQL:*\n",
    "By setting up PostGraphile, we automatically generate a high-performance GraphQL API from our PostgreSQL database. This enables us to harness the power of GraphQL to query our data with more flexibility and efficiency. The GraphiQL interface serves as a playground to test and visualize different GraphQL queries, facilitating the backend development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Integration with Apollo Client:*\n",
    "To connect our Next.js front-end with the GraphQL API, we will be using Apollo Client. It will allow us to fetch, cache, and modify the data in our database seamlessly, making the management of the state in our app more straightforward and more scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Demonstrating Data Engineering Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Database Integration:*\n",
    "We demonstrate how to integrate a PostgreSQL database with a front-end application, emphasizing maintaining data integrity and optimizing query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Front-end Development with Next.js:*\n",
    "Our project showcases how to develop a dynamic and responsive front-end using Next.js, a popular React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Docker-Compose File Modifications**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Introduction of Next.js Service:*\n",
    "We added a new service to our docker-compose file to create a container for the Next.js application. We used the latest version of the node image to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. The working directory is set to `/app`, and the necessary environment variables and volume mappings are defined to integrate with the other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Network Configuration:*\n",
    "All the services are connected on a custom network, `my-network`, which allows them to communicate with each other seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  nextjs:\n",
    "    image: node:latest\n",
    "    container_name: nextjs_app\n",
    "    working_dir: /app\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      - NODE_ENV=development\n",
    "    volumes:\n",
    "      - ./react-app:/app\n",
    "    command: bash -c \"cd /app && npm install && npm run dev\"\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - \"3000:3000\"\n",
    "    networks:\n",
    "      - my-network\n",
    "    depends_on:\n",
    "      postgraphile:\n",
    "        condition: service_started\n"

   "source": [
    "### **2. React App Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Creating the React App:*\n",
    "We initialized a new Next.js application in a directory named `react-app` using the command `npx create-next-app react-app`, opting to include features such as TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS to enhance the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Directory Structure:*\n",
    "We opted to use a `src/` directory for organizing our components and an app router for managing the routes in our application. Additionally, we customized the default import alias to streamline the import process in our project."

    "## React Components Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layout Component (`Layout.tsx`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Layout` component serves as a container for the various sections of your application. It includes a header, main content area, and a footer. The `Layout` component accepts `children` as a prop, which means other components can be nested within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "const Layout: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div className=\"layout\">\n",
    "      <header className=\"header\">\n",
    "        <h1 className=\"title\">Stock Trading Platform</h1>\n",
    "      </header>\n",
    "      <main className=\"main\">\n",
    "        {children}\n",
    "      </main>\n",
    "      <footer className=\"footer\">\n",
    "        <p>Â© 2024 Stock Trading Platform</p>\n",

    "  );\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Layout;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Reusable**: This component can be used to wrap any page or component to maintain a consistent layout across different pages.\n",
    "2. **Styling**: The `style jsx` section includes CSS to style the layout, header, title, main content area, and footer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Page Component (`index.tsx`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Page component is the landing page of your application. It is structured with two main sections: Stocks and Portfolio Summary. Each section has a respective placeholder for where the data tables will be inserted in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import Layout from '../components/Layout';\n",
    "\n",
    "const HomePage: React.FC = () => {\n",
    "  return (\n",

    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Component Structure**: This component is structured to have two main sections: one for displaying stock information and another for displaying the portfolio summary.\n",
    "2. **Usage of Layout Component**: The `Layout` component is used to wrap the content of the home page, ensuring that the header and footer are consistently displayed.\n",
    "3. **Placeholders**: The placeholders for the Stocks Table Component and Portfolio Summary Table Component are ready to integrate data fetching and display components.\n",

    "### Setting up Apollo Client\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   To facilitate interaction with the GraphQL API, set up the Apollo Client by running the following command in the project directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npm install @apollo/client graphql\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Apollo Client Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an Apollo Client instance to connect to the GraphQL server. Create a file named apolloClient.ts in the root of your project with the following code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```jsx\n",
    "    import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';\n",
    "\n",
    "    const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({\n",
    "      uri: 'http://localhost:5001/graphql', // Ensure this URL matches your GraphQL server URL\n",
    "      cache: new InMemoryCache(),\n",
    "    });\n",
    "\n",
    "    export default apolloClient;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Setting Up GraphQL Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Next, create GraphQL queries to fetch data from the server. Create a file named getStocks.ts in a folder named graphql with the following content:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```jsx\n",
    "    import { gql } from '@apollo/client';\n",
    "\n",
    "    export const GET_STOCKS = gql`\n",
    "      query GetStocks {\n",

    "          }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    `;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Integrating Apollo Client with Next.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, integrate the Apollo Client with Next.js by creating a file named _app.tsx in the pages directory. Include the following code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```jsx\n",
    "    import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';\n",
    "    import apolloClient from 'apollo-client';  // Adjust the path as necessary\n",
    "    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';\n",

    "        <ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>\n",
    "          <Component {...pageProps} />\n",

    "\n",
    "    export default MyApp;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Enhancing the HomePage Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "    After the initial setup, enhance the HomePage component to display the data in a table format. Update the index.tsx file to incorporate a table structure and style it accordingly:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```tsx\n",
    "    import React from 'react';\n",
