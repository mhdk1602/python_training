    "## Schema Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema modeling is an important aspect of data engineering, as it helps structure your data in a way that is efficient for querying and easy to understand. There are different types of schema modeling approaches, such as star schema, snowflake schema, and hybrid schema (which combines elements of both star and snowflake). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss each of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Star Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a star schema, a central fact table is connected to one or more dimension tables via foreign key relationships. The fact table contains quantitative data (e.g., sales, revenue) and keys to join with the dimension tables. Dimension tables store descriptive attributes (e.g., customer information, product details) and are usually denormalized, meaning they contain redundant data to minimize the number of joins required during querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Star schema is a popular choice for data warehouse design because of its simplicity and query performance advantages. Here's an example of a star schema in the context of a retail sales data warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a retail company wants to analyze its sales data. A typical star schema for this scenario would have a central fact table (Fact_Sales) and several dimension tables, such as Dim_Date, Dim_Product, Dim_Customer, and Dim_Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fact_Sales (fact table): This table contains quantitative data (measures) about each sale, such as:\n",
    "sales_id (primary key)\n",
    "date_id (foreign key to Dim_Date)\n",
    "product_id (foreign key to Dim_Product)\n",
    "customer_id (foreign key to Dim_Customer)\n",
    "store_id (foreign key to Dim_Store)\n",
    "quantity_sold\n",
    "total_price\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dim_Date (dimension table): This table stores information about dates, such as:\n",
    "date_id (primary key)\n",
    "date\n",
    "day_of_week\n",
    "day_of_month\n",
    "month\n",
    "quarter\n",
    "year\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dim_Product (dimension table): This table contains information about products, such as:\n",
    "product_id (primary key)\n",
    "product_name\n",
    "category\n",
    "subcategory\n",
    "brand\n",
    "color\n",
    "size\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dim_Customer (dimension table): This table stores information about customers, such as:\n",
    "customer_id (primary key)\n",
    "first_name\n",
    "last_name\n",
    "email\n",
    "phone\n",
    "address\n",
    "city\n",
    "state\n",
    "country\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dim_Store (dimension table): This table holds information about store locations, such as:\n",
    "store_id (primary key)\n",
    "store_name\n",
    "address\n",
    "city\n",
    "state\n",
