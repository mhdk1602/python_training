    "## Introduction to Data Streaming and Real-time Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern data architectures, data streaming and real-time processing hold a pivotal role. Unlike batch processing, which handles large, finite sets of data, data streaming processes data in real-time, allowing for instantaneous analysis and action. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios such as fraud detection, monitoring systems, and real-time analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data streaming is seamlessly integrated with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, enhancing scalability and offering robust solutions for real-time data handling. Let's delve deeper into the tools and libraries that facilitate real-time data processing in Python.\n",

    "### Apache Kafka\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, and incredibly fast, facilitating real-time analytics and monitoring. Kafka's real power comes from its ability to manage streams of data from various sources, making it a popular choice for organizations looking to analyze and process large streams of data in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Features and Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>High Throughput:</b> Capable of handling millions of messages per second, making it suitable for high-speed data analytics.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Scalability:</b> Can easily scale horizontally to accommodate growing data streams.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Fault Tolerance:</b> Provides built-in fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple brokers.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Durability:</b> Ensures data persistence on disk, safeguarding against data loss.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with Apache Kafka in Python, the first step is to install the Kafka-Python library, a Python client for Apache Kafka. You can install it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code class=\"language-python\">\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">!pip install</font> kafka-python\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",

    "#### 4. Configuring Kafka Producers and Consumers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will delve into how you can set up and configure Kafka producers and consumers using Python. Below are Python snippets that demonstrate how to initialize Kafka producers and consumers and how to send and receive messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code class=\"language-python\">\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">from</font> kafka <font color=\"blue\">import</font> KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer\n",

    "producer.send(<font color=\"green\">'sample_topic'</font>, value=<font color=\"green\">b'Hello, Kafka'</font>)\n",
    "producer.flush()\n",
