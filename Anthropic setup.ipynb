    "### Overview of the Script\n",
    "Our script is designed to generate insightful Q&A pairs that delve deep into the themes, characters, and pivotal events of the novel. The script divides the book into sections and generates Q&A pairs for each section by providing a detailed prompt to the Claude model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need for `anthropic_qa_generate_prompt.txt`\n",
    "The `anthropic_qa_generate_prompt.txt` is a vital component in our script as it contains the base prompt that guides the Claude model to formulate questions and answers. This file includes a brief description of the novel, key characters, and aspects that the generated Q&A pairs should focus on, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character Evolution**: Particularly focusing on the development of Tom Sawyer as he matures through his adventures.\n",
    "2. **Role and Influence of Friendship**: Analyzing the significance of friendship, especially the influence of Huck Finn on Tom.\n",
    "3. **Depiction of Societal Norms**: Understanding the societal norms and values of the period depicted in the novel, and how characters navigate them.\n",
    "4. **Moral Dilemmas**: Investigating moments where characters undergo moral testing and what these instances reveal about them.\n",
    "5. **Humor and Satire**: Exploring how Mark Twain utilizes humor and satire to critique society and human nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing this detailed prompt, we aim to get Q&A pairs that not only reflect on the plot but also provoke thoughtful discussions on the underlying messages and the relevance of Twain's observations in today's world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Book Text into Memory\n",
    "To enable the model to generate meaningful Q&A pairs based on specific sections of the book, our script reads the text from specified pages and includes it in the prompt. This is done to provide the model with the necessary context, as it doesn't have access to external databases or the ability to reference specific pages from the book.\n",

       "[{'prompt': 'How might the incident with the spelling book foreshadow later events in terms of the escalation of revenge and stakes involved?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Alfred spiting Tom through the spelling book parallels the back-and-forth revenge between Tom and Becky. It's another small act of retaliation that ends up having more severe unintended consequences, foreshadowing how quickly things will spiral out of control between Tom and Becky over similar teenage interpersonal conflicts.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What might Twain be suggesting through Aunt Polly's internal conflict regarding whether to look in Tom's jacket pocket or not?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"He highlights the complex duality of human nature - Aunt Polly is torn between strict moral judgment and compassionate love for her nephew. This ambivalence mirrors Tom's own complicated blend of mischievousness and good-heartedness.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does Twain's use of humor serve his exploration of morality and the human condition in this passage?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'The humor adds levity and prevents a sanctimonious tone even while examining moral questions. It suggests moral absolutism misses the messiness of real psychology - adding empathy even for flawed characters. The humor makes the themes more thought-provoking.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does Tom's willingness to take the punishment for Becky reveal about his character and values?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"It shows that underneath Tom's mischievousness, he has a strong moral compass and sense of justice. He is unwilling to let someone else take the fall for something he did, even if it means facing consequences himself. It demonstrates his courage, integrity and loyalty.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How do you think this experience impacted Tom's views on honesty and accountability moving forward?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Facing the shame and punishment of admitting the truth likely reinforced for Tom the importance of honesty and taking responsibility for one's actions. He learns that while deception may briefly avoid consequences, true courage comes from accountability. This could inspire him to greater truthfulness.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What role do you think their friendship played in Tom's decision? Would he have done the same for any student?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Tom and Becky share a special connection. His willingness to face punishment for her reveals how much he cares for her. While Tom has a strong moral compass, his bond with Becky and refusing to see her shamed specifically prompts his confession. He likely wouldn't have risked the same for just any student.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How do you think this act transformed Tom in Becky's eyes? What might change between them?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"This likely elevated Tom in Becky's estimation, from a silly prankster to a loyal, noble friend who would make immense sacrifices for those he cares about. It could profoundly alter their dynamic, built on deeper affection and respect. The selflessness Tom displays could resonate with Becky for years.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What connections might students make between this episode and examples of integrity in current events or their own lives?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Students might relate to peers taking blame to protect friends. Tom's example could inspire readers to take responsibility when they make mistakes that affect others, even at personal cost - demonstrating courage and integrity. The theme of admitting truth over convenient deception remains highly relevant today.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does the punishment Tom receives for taking Becky's blame reveal his moral growth as a character? What does this moment signify for Tom?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Tom's willingness to be punished in Becky's place even though he knows it will be severe demonstrates his deepening care and sense of responsibility toward her. Previously focused largely on himself, this self-sacrifice shows Tom's maturation and that he prioritizes Becky over his own interests. This pivot signifies Tom transitioning into more noble adulthood.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What is significant about the fact that Tom falls asleep at the end thinking happily about Becky's praise for his honorable actions?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"It demonstrates that Tom is more fulfilled by Becky recognizing the moral nobility of his deed than he would have been by childish revenge against Alfred. This suggests Tom has developed a more mature moral framework focused on doing right for its own sake and winning Becky's sincere respect.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does Twain distinguish between childhood and adulthood in this passage? What might that say about his views on the process of maturing?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"The desire for vengeance Tom initially feels is set against his final feelings of pleasure from Becky calling him noble. This distinction indicates Twain sees the transition to mature adulthood as marked by moving from petty grievances to more meaningful moral awareness and connection to others. It's shown as a gradual process for Tom.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does Twain use Tom's struggles with the Cadets of Temperance to comment on morality and conscience?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Tom joins the Cadets to make a public show of virtue and restraint, but privately struggles against his desires to drink and swear. This highlights the gap between outward appearances and inward drives. Twain suggests the importance of living by internal moral conviction rather than external social pressure.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What critique might Twain be making through the various disappointments and boredom Tom experiences on his vacation?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"The anticlimactic events of Tom's long-awaited freedom suggest that reality often falls short of fantasy and expectations. Twain may be prodding the reader to reflect on what truly constitutes a rewarding life amidst the constraints of society. There are hints that meaning arises from creative engagement rather than escaping burdens.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How might the inflated praise for the overly ornate student compositions reveal a subtle social commentary by Twain?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'The effusive praise highlights empty platitudes over meaningful substance. Twain satirizes hollow social rituals and inflated egos obsessed with extravagant appearances, blind to reality. This ties back to the theme of image versus truth.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What is the significance of the line \"There had been a \\'revival\\' and everybody had \\'got religion,\\' not only the adults, but even the boys and girls\"?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'This line captures the sweeping religious transformation that has taken place in the town. The revival meetings have led every resident, even the young children, to become devoutly religious. This dramatic shift alienates Tom, who feels suddenly sinful and isolated from the community he knows.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How do Tom\\'s friends citing scripture and becoming model citizens add \"ton to his depression\"?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Tom highly valued his carefree, mischievous childhood with his friends. Seeing all his friends transform into almost unrecognizable pious children depresses Tom profoundly. It adds further weight or \"tons\" to his feelings of loneliness and not belonging.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What might Twain's portrayal of the overblown thunderstorm suggest about religious zeal?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'The exaggerated storm echoes the revivalist fervor. Twain appears to critique the idea of a wrathful, vindictive God through this parody. The storm passes without real damage, perhaps indicating such religious intensity is ultimately not sustainable or substantive. Let me know if you have any other questions!'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why do you think Tom brings the dead cat to the graveyard? What might this unusual choice symbolize?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"The dead cat seems to represent Tom's childlike imagination and tendency toward mischief. Even when involves in serious matters, part of him remains an adventurous boy. The cat underscores his innocence.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How would you describe the mood in the courtroom when Tom takes the witness stand? Why might the crowd react with such \"puzzled amazement\"?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"There is likely a tense, stunned mood as all expect Potter's lawyer to make a last attempt at defending him. Tom's appearance confounds every prediction, intriguing the crowd.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does the judge's need to repeatedly urge Tom to speak up suggest about his demeanor on the stand?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Tom clearly struggles to find his voice, intimating his fear and anxiety. His hesitation reveals the immense internal strain of testifying.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'In what ways might Tom testifying represent both courage and growth for his character?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Speaking the hard truth before Injun Joe demonstrates great personal courage for Tom, despite fears for his safety. It shows Tom maturing into acting for the greater good.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How do you expect the courtroom revelations to impact events and characters moving forward in the story?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'It may initiate confrontation with Injun Joe and lead to climactic moments for key characters. The truth coming out can set major plot resolution in motion on themes of justice.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'In the conversation between Tom and Huck, Tom says that if they find treasure he is \"going to buy a new drum, and a sure\\'nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.\" What does this tell us about Tom\\'s character and priorities at this point in his life?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Tom's planned use of his share of treasure mainly reflects boyish interests - his desire for adventure, play, and fun rather than any sensible or practical aims. His top priority of getting married also seems to be a fanciful decision reflective of his young age and romantic imagination rather than any well-thought out intention. Overall it gives us a glimpse into Tom's carefree, youthful mindset that is preoccupied with games, make-believe, elevating his status amongst peers, and distant life goals rather than current responsibilities or duties. It's a charming snapshot of a young boy lost in his small dreams and aspirations.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why does Huck initially bring up superstitions like Friday being unlucky before going to the haunted house? What might this foreshadow?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Huck's superstitious nature makes him wary of danger or trouble. This foreshadows the real danger they witness with Injun Joe at the haunted house. Huck's instincts warn him something bad may happen.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How do Tom and Huck play at being Robin Hood, and how does this characterize them?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'They romanticize the idea of robbing the rich to give to the poor. This shows their youthful innocence and sense of childish adventure, before reality sets in.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What is significant about the boys being paralyzed by fear rather than running when they hear Injun Joe?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'It shows they are gripped by the true terror and evil Injun Joe represents. No longer just a game, they now face real villainy and peril.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why might the dilapidated haunted house reflect the wider decomposition of morality in society?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'The rotting house mirrors how Injun Joe and his plans decay innocence and endanger the community. It represents the breakdown of moral codes.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How might witnessing Injun Joe's plotting be a loss of innocence for Tom and Huck?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"It turns their boyish adventure into a serious predicament. They lose innocence through exposure to true crime that entangles their fate with the thieves'.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why does Injun Joe react so angrily when he sees the tools with fresh dirt on them? What might this reveal about his state of mind?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'He becomes paranoid, immediately assuming spies or ghosts left the tools to monitor their treasure hunting. It reveals his volatile nerves and tendency toward superstitious credulity when confronted with the unknown.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does the collapse of the staircase end up profoundly impacting the subsequent plot?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'It prevents Injun Joe from discovering Tom and Huck hiding, allowing them to overhear crucial information about his planned revenge and Number Two hideout. This drives much of the remaining plot.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What might the treasure symbolize, both as a practical matter and as a more metaphorical motif?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"On a literal level, it represents wealth and prosperity. Symbolically, it signifies man's timeless quest for fortune, stashable belongings as a salve for mortality, and the extremes people go to pursuing ephemeral riches.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"When Tom worries the revenge may be aimed at them, what might this foreshadow about the tale's impending confrontation?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'It is potentially an early foreshadowing of the clash to come between the forces of good (Tom & Huck) and evil (Injun Joe). It previews courage in the face of malevolence.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does the final line regarding Tom facing danger alone versus with company serve as a thematic statement?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'It establishes the centrality of friendship and community to coping with adversity - the importance of \"company\" in making peril feel surmountable. It asserts the saving power of camaraderie.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"Twain juxtaposes the boys' exciting adventure with darker themes like revenge and danger. How does this passage blend these elements? What is the overall effect?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"The thrill of Tom and Huck's secret mission becomes tinged with menace when Injun Joe is unexpectedly introduced. This heightens the drama and suspense, while also underscoring the risks the boys face. It blends an entertaining adventure tale with gravitas.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"Tom prioritizes protecting his aunt's property (the lantern and towel) over confronting Injun Joe. What does this reveal about Tom's values and sense of accountability at this point in his development?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"It highlights Tom's immaturity and misplaced priorities, putting material goods over justice or responsibility. This suggests Tom has moral maturing still to do over the course of his adventures.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'The passage ends on a reveal about the \"haunted room\" that builds anticipation. How might superstitious views cloud rationality? What halo effect might that produce?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"The community's superstitions substitute reason with speculation and fantasy about the room, creating a halo effect of imagined mystery. Twain suggests how irrational beliefs propagate and overwrite facts.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Huck struggles with anxiety, fear and still trusts Tom. How would you characterize the dynamics of their friendship based on this scene?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Despite anxieties, Huck sticks by Tom with implicit trust, underscoring the deep loyalty and affinity of their boyhood bond. Huck seems to draw courage and reassurance from Tom's presence.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does Tom rationalize going against Aunt Polly's wishes for Becky to stay with Susy Harper? What does this reveal about him?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Tom justifies disobeying Aunt Polly's request by telling Becky that her mother merely wants Becky to be safe, and that she would have allowed Becky to go to the Widow Douglas' if she had thought of it. He argues that Aunt Polly doesn't need to know about their change of plans. This rationalization demonstrates Tom's talent for self-justification and manipulation to serve his own desires. It reveals his moral flexibility and willingness to make excuses to pursue enjoyable adventures over obedience. This foreshadows the moral choices Tom will continue to face between following his own whims and doing what authority figures ask of him.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What does the incident with Injun Joe and his partner reveal about moral growth and moral testing for both Tom and Huck?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'This harrowing incident serves as a pivotal moral test for both boys. For Tom, though not present, it represents the consequences of his childish games - his friends and loved ones now face mortal danger due to his carelessness with the treasure map. It is a sobering wake-up call that forces Tom toward greater maturity and responsibility. For Huck, who witnesses the villains firsthand, it tests his sense of justice and compassion. Though afraid, he risks warning Widow Douglas, showing his moral growth. He passes the test through courageous action, not just hollow words. Overall, the incident serves as a trial by fire for both boys on their path to maturity. By confronting the realities of true peril, they start to develop the moral fiber needed to transition from carefree childhood to principled adulthood.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"Why does Huck reveal Injun Joe's identity to the Welshman after initially protecting him? What does this suggest about Huck's moral development?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Huck decides to trust the Welshman and reveal Injun Joe's identity because the Welshman promises secrecy and protection. This is a pivotal moment showing Huck beginning to choose right over wrong, even when it puts him at risk - representing his moral awakening.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What is ironic about the townspeople flocking to stare at the scene of the attempted robbery? What point do you think Twain is making?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"It's ironic that the townspeople are more curious and hungry for excitement than concerned about justice being served. This satirizes the obliviousness and distortion of societal values - Twain's critique of corrupt morals running deep despite the appearance of righteousness.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does Aunt Polly's desperate search for Tom reveal about her feelings for him?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'It shows that beneath her harsh scoldings, Aunt Polly deeply cares for Tom. Her frantic efforts to find him demonstrate the love and concern she has for him as his guardian.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"In what way does the community's reaction show the themes of fellowship and unity in times of crisis?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'The whole town instantly pulls together to search for the missing children, setting aside all other concerns. This demonstrates how crisis can unite people in fellowship and shared purpose.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why does Huck ask about Tom despite being severely ill himself?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"It highlights the selfless bond of friendship between the two boys. Even in his delirious state, Huck's thoughts turn to his best friend as he worries for Tom's sake over anyone else's.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What keeps some people clinging to hope against bleak odds in the search?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Love and refusal to abandon those missing drives them on. Though the outlook is grim, their care for the children makes them stubbornly hopeful.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why might the widow cry at the end even though there is no news?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'She is likely crying in despair and grief as hopes of finding them alive fade, mourning the loss of Becky.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does Twain depict the harshness of the environment and its impact on the children?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Twain creates an intensely unforgiving setting through descriptions like \"the horror of utter darkness\" and the \"deadly perils\" of the cave\\'s hidden pits and passages. Details such as the dwindling candle and the children\\'s expanding hunger make the bleakness felt viscerally. Becky and Tom\\'s alternating despair and hope conveys the psychological toll. By subjecting them to such a merciless place, Twain lays bare their vulnerability and inner resources for persevering. The severity of the cave intensifies the narratives stakes and the admiration we feel for the children as they cope.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does the discovery of the treasure box represent a transition point for both Tom and Huck? What might this foreshadow about their characters' future moral and personal development?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Finding the treasure box marks a certain loss of innocence for Tom and Huck. While it provides excitement and adventure, it also exposes them to more adult ideas like robbery, ransom, and wealth. This foreshadows how their childlike escapades will eventually force them to grapple with more complex moral issues and responsibilities. The way they handle the treasure is a precursor for that future growth.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why do you think Tom insists they must have \"orgies\" along with playing robber? What might this suggest about his imagination and concept of adulthood at this point?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Tom likely has a dramatic but naive idea of what adult outlaws and robbers do based on romanticized stories. His insistence on orgies shows his limited childlike understanding of mature activities, despite longing for liberation and rebellion against society's rules. It is a glimpse into his adolescent conception of freedom, shaped largely by adventure tales and fantasies.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What role does superstition play in this passage? Why is Huck more superstitious than Tom, and how does Twain use that as commentary?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Huck's superstitious nature makes him wary of Injun Joe's ghost haunting the treasure spot, while pragmatic Tom needs more practical persuasion. Twain uses this to comment on Huck's less educated background and vulnerability compared to Tom's privilege and romantic worldview. It also shows the tension between imagination, fear, and early rationalism.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"Why does Huck feel so uncomfortable at the widow's party even though she is honoring him? What does this say about his character?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Huck feels out of place in fancy clothes and society settings. He values simplicity and freedom - the party constraints feel strange and artificial to him. This shows Huck has an authentic character at odds with societal pretensions.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does the community's reaction to Tom and Huck's money reveal some of Twain’s satire about human nature?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Twain satirizes how the villagers now fawn over the boys just because they are wealthy, despite formerly not valuing them highly. This pokes fun at the hypocritical tendency to admire people for superficial reasons like money over character.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What is ironic about the great emphasis placed on Tom and Huck’s money versus the true source of their admirable traits?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"It's ironic the villagers now praise aspects like Huck’s honesty and Tom’s creativity, when they scorned them as rascals before. This highlights how money distorts perspective on substantive virtues.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Discuss the irony of Huck feeling a robber is \"more high-toned than what a pirate is\" when both are criminals. What does this reveal about social conditioning versus moral facts?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'It highlights society’s glorification of criminals based on elite status associations. Twain satirizes the dissonance between superficial social status versus underlying unethical deeds.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How is Huck\\'s statement \"If she\\'ll let up on some of the roughest things, I\\'ll smoke private and cuss private\" indicative of his moral priorities? What does it reveal about his character?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'It shows personal autonomy matters more to Huck than public decorum. Unlike Tom, Huck prioritizes intrinsic moral independence over external social codes, showing his authenticity.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What latent social commentary does Twain make by showing the boys equate symbolic rituals like oaths in cemeteries with the substantive concept of honor among thieves?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Twain satirizes the adult world’s own false equations of appearing honorable versus acting morally. The oaths reflect the same superficial symbols over meaningful substance.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What is the significance of Aunt Polly and Mrs. Harper's strong belief in Tom's dream?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Their eager credulity highlights the prevalence of superstition in Southern culture at the time. Twain satirizes their rejection of rational skepticism, using it to critique the lack of critical thinking. Their emotional reaction also shows how dreams can subjectively feel like reality.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does Tom's newfound fame change his behavior and attitudes? What does this suggest about human nature?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Tom becomes arrogant and dismissive towards his friends, suggesting that fame fuels ego, vanity and insensitivity even in children. Twain implies that moral development lags behind social awareness during youth. The passage highlights the corrupting influence of status and peer regard.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What is symbolic about Tom's indifference towards Becky and growing attraction to Amy?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"It reflects the capriciousness of childhood crushes and Tom's lack of emotional maturity. He fails to consider Becky's feelings in his self-absorption. This highlights how inexperience, insensitivity and peer influence impacts social behavior development.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does Twain's portrayal of Tom's imaginary fight scene reveal key aspects of Tom's character and moral development at this stage?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"The imaginary fight scene provides insight into Tom's impulsive and violence-prone nature at this point in the story. His jealousy and hurt ego make him fantasize about physically assaulting his perceived rival, Alfred/the “Saint Louis smarty”. The vivid scene depicts Tom self-righteously attacking the imaginary boy, underscoring his pettiness and lack of self-control when emotionally provoked. He is ruled by ego and raw impulse. However, the fact that the fight occurs solely in his imagination points to Tom still having some moral awareness and restraint. He recognizes that actually thrashing Alfred would have consequences he wants to avoid. This shows his moral development is incomplete but ongoing. He is struggling with his “conscience” and sense of right and wrong, even as he fails to master his anger and tendency towards melodramatic visions of violence. The inner turmoil and moral awakening Tom experiences prepares the ground for his future ethical growth and maturation. So while depicting his flaws, the scene underscores Tom's potential and foreshadows the responsible adult Tom could become.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why does Tom initially plan to let Becky take the blame for the torn book? What does this reveal about his character?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Tom plans to let Becky take the blame out of spite and wounded pride because she had scolded and threatened to \"tell on him.\" His scheming exposes pettiness, vindictiveness, and lack of empathy in Tom’s character. He trivializes the injustice Becky would suffer, dismissing the trauma of being “licked” as “just what a girl deserves.” This highlights Tom’s immaturity and lack of moral compass at this point.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How do the reactions of Becky and Tom to the crisis of the torn book compare? What does this suggest about gender roles and norms at the time?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'While Becky is paralyzed by fear and helplessness, Tom impulsively takes action. Becky lacks agency and courage, tears streaming down her face. In contrast, Tom heroically speaks up, if recklessly, showing initiative and bravery. Twain plays with gender stereotypes - the weak, emotional girl and daring, stoic boy. The differential treatment they would receive for the same offense further reflects the gender double standard.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"In what ways is Tom's confession scene ironic, and how does irony serve Twain’s larger message?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'It is poetically ironic that Tom takes the fall after planning the opposite. The cruel teacher is outwitted when the falsely accused “noble” culprit thwarts his show of absolute power. This demonstrates principles winning over pettiness while undermining abusive authority, exemplifying Twain’s anti-establishment sentiment. The irony compounds when only after resolving to betray Becky does Tom recognize his conscience. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does Tom's humiliating failure during his speech say about the tension between conforming to societal expectations versus pursuing rebellious freedom?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Tom's speech debacle symbolizes his ongoing struggle to balance meeting norms and chasing liberation. His eventual moral maturation may involve sincerely choosing accountability over mere appearances, integrating both conformity and rebellion.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does Twain’s mockery of the young ladies’ compositions reveal his critique of gender roles and limited aspirations imposed on women at the time?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'The sarcastic tone toward the girls’ florid writing suggests Twain is criticizing not just their conditioned performances, but also the narrow horizons and vocations considered proper for women then. He implicates societal sexism.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Twain satirizes shallow moral platitudes here. How might this connect to the novel’s exploration of sincerely held faith and religion?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'While critiquing empty piety, Twain does portray authentic belief in characters like Aunt Polly. This contrast highlights both hypocrisy in pious posturing and the possibility for inward spirituality over public pontification.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How might the pressure of rigid examinations for mere performance over actual learning speak to Twain’s broader critique of societal attainment markers?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Twain hints flaws in prizes, grades, contests - esteemed markers of achievement that become ends unto themselves, estranged from nurturing creativity, self-awareness, and service. Applause can trump inner growth.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does the ruined map drawing incident reveal the attitudes of the students towards their teacher?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"The students' reaction of uncontrolled laughter when the teacher unsuccessfully tries to draw a map highlights their lack of respect for his authority. Their delight at his failure suggests resentment or animosity towards him. Twain shows how the teacher has likely mistreated the students in the past, making them eager for any opportunity to undermine him. The dynamic shows the flaws of an education system based more on strict order than nurturing children's minds and spirits. The prank itself, dropping a cat onto the teacher's head, further emphasizes the students' spirit of rebellion and mischief fueled by their dislike of their instructor. Ultimately, the incident serves to critique both the cruelty of certain teaching methods as well as the natural inclination of children to resist oppressive control over them. Through humor, Twain paints a broader commentary on education and child-adult relationships of his time.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does Tom's joining and then quickly quitting the Cadets of Temperance tell us about his character?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'It shows Tom craving maturity and importance through joining an esteemed group, but ultimately his youthful spirit of independence and temptation to misbehave win out. This reflects the inner tension Tom feels pulled between childhood freedom and expectations to grow up.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does Twain portray the religious revival in the town? What point might he be making?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Twain paints it as excessive joylessness that drains life from the young people. This suggests gentle critique of moral zealotry weighing too heavily on youthful spirit.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"Why is the loss of his friends' company so devastating to Tom? What does this reveal about what matters most to him now?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"Companionship and sharing adventures are pillars of Tom's world. Losing this human connection ravages his identity and youthful spirit. It shows how vital these bonds of friendship are for his well-being and growth.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does Injun Joe encroach on the children's world in this passage? What might Twain be exploring?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"As an adult murderer, Injun Joe represents loss of innocence, shattering the bubble of childhood purity and exposing more sinister undercurrents of life. This reflects Twain's commentary on the inevitable maturation from youthful naivete.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Do you think the coming-of-age themes Twain explores here still resonate with young people today? Why or why not?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Yes, because the tensions between order and rebellion, moral zealotry extremes, and the difficulty of preserving innocence in an imperfect world remain relatable human experiences. Twain tapped into certain universal truths.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What is the significance of Tom testifying against Injun Joe despite his fears?',\n",

       " {'prompt': 'The crowd responds with fascinated impatience for justice - what critique of human nature does this offer?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Their bloodthirsty impatience satirizes the hypocrisy and lack of empathy in mob mentality, even amidst civic processes. Twain criticizes such tendencies by highlighting how people enjoy spectacles over upholding high-minded values.'},\n",

       "  'completion': \"Tom's tall tales about kings having multiple humpbacked servants named Richard showcase his active imagination and tendency to embellish reality even as an older child on the cusp of adolescence. It highlights his childlike wonder and appetite for fantasy over mundane truth.\"},\n",

       "  'completion': 'Huck instantly recognizes marriage as a source of conflict from his difficult home life, whereas Tom still holds idealized notions of romance and adult life. This realism versus romanticism foreshadows Huck continuing to face life’s harsh truths head-on as he runs from his father, while Tom delays maturity and consequences, clinging to childhood innocence.'},\n",

       "  'completion': 'The haunted, sinister mood echoes the boys’ inner anxiety - their nascent recognition that trespassing and stealing, even buried treasure, transgresses moral boundaries. It becomes a metaphor for the quiet weight of guilt and conscience they feel but cannot yet fully confront or articulate.'},\n",

       "  'completion': \"This harrowing eavesdropping is a decisive test of the boys' mettle. Though terrified and tempted to flee, they find the resolve to stay put with Injun Joe and danger nearby. Their pluck reveals growth in moral courage from earlier adventures. Staying steadfast in peril goes against self-protection and requires digging deep internally for composure and duty - the mark of moral bravery. Ultimately, Tom rises slowly to exit while the shaking Huck remains, showing both have limits in valiantly confronting trepidation. Still, their grit stands out more than flight. This trial by fire steels their moral fiber to do the right thing despite ominous threats. That they come this far signifies maturing, hardship-forged courage - even if foolhardy bravado remains Tom’s tendency. Regardless, their more steadfast mettle together foretells even sterner tests ahead requiring moral courage in standing up to vice.\"},\n",

       " {'prompt': 'Why do Tom and Huck only search the tavern at night?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"They only search at night because that's when the tavern closes up, the lights go out, and nobody is likely to spot them sneaking inside to search room #2. They wait for the cover of darkness to conduct their search secretly.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What causes Tom to flee from room #2 so quickly after entering it? Why doesn't he take the time to properly search for the money?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Tom flees because as soon as he enters with the lantern, he nearly steps on the sleeping body of dangerous Injun Joe. The shock and fear of discovery causes Tom to abandon the search quickly without finding the money.'},\n",

       "  'completion': 'Tom knows deceiving them is wrong, yet he easily justifies doing it anyway in pursuit of his own fun. This shows that while Tom has some emerging moral understanding, his development is still incomplete and he prioritizes his self interests over ethical considerations.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'How does Twain use the character of Huck Finn to critique racial attitudes of the time period?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Huck's willingness to ignore societal barriers and interact equally with a black man named Uncle Jake challenges racist conventions. This exemplifies how Twain uses Huck's nonconformity to underscore the arbitrary and unjust nature of racial attitudes in the antebellum South.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What might the elaborate cave system symbolize in relation to the themes of social codes and conscience?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"The endless tunnels mirror the complex navigation all people must make through society's moral codes and maturation processes. Just as deceptions hide within the cave, the surface realities of society can conceal troubles one fails to foresee due to immaturity.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does Tom's internal conflict about whether to seek the treasure or attend the picnic suggest about his character?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'His excitement over the treasure outweighing his ethical concerns shows his moral development is not yet complete. The internal discord highlights how he still prioritizes thrill and self-interest over consideration for how his duplicity impacts others.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Why does Huck insist that his identity as the informant remain secret? What might this suggest about his views of society?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'When the Welshman praises Huck for providing the crucial information about the criminals\\' identities, Huck repeatedly pleads with him \"Oh, please don\\'t tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please don\\'t tell!\". Huck\\'s intense desire for anonymity likely stems from an engrained wariness of how society perceives him as an outcast and vagabond. He fears potential retaliation from the criminals should word get out. Moreover, having society view him positively for his civic duty of reporting the criminals probably feels unfamiliar and threatening to him as well. Huck has learned to remain unseen and disconnected from mainstream social structures. So bringing positive attention onto himself by aiding law enforcement and opposing dangerous criminals may prove disorienting for Huck\\'s self-identity and security. Through this, Twain suggests the psychological barriers that isolate marginal figures from feeling part of orderly society. Though Huck seeks justice, he remains distinctly an outsider unable and unwilling to find a place within, indicating the deep social alienation of those branded as pariahs.'},\n",

       "  'completion': 'When Tom produces their \"wedding cake\" to assuage Becky\\'s hunger, it highlights the sweet naivete of their childhood bond and games of playing bride-and-groom. Yet it also foreshadows sorrow, as Becky observes it would have been \"our [wedding cake]—\" but cannot complete the sentence, as if intuitively sensing their prospects are doomed. The small cake intended for playful dreaming cannot alleviate the stark waking nightmare they face. Its meager size underscores their helplessness, prompting tears from Becky and remorse from Tom for thoughtlessly endangering her life. The tragic irony is they may never reach adulthood to fulfill their \"promise.\" Still, their devotion is touchingly simple and complete in the moment. Sharing the pathetically small crumbs embodies both wholeness of innocent love and the fragility of their imperiled state.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"What does the boys' discussion about ransoming and not killing women captives reveal about their notions of robbery and gender?\",\n",
       "  'completion': 'Their fanciful ideas about robbery as an adventurous, gentlemanly pursuit indicate a romanticized, immature perspective shaped by books and popular myths that overlook its traumatic consequences. Their chivalrous sparing of female hostages reflects prevailing paternalistic attitudes that objectified women as delicate creatures requiring male protection.'},\n",
       " {'prompt': \"How does the candle-marked cross demonstrate the way superstitions governed people's perceptions and actions at that time?\",\n",
       "  'completion': \"The cross symbol starkly embodies the era's religious inferences about events. The boys' debate over its magical properties versus rational explanations reveals the spectrum of supernatural beliefs influencing frontier thought and deeds.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'What might Twain be saying about human nature by having deadly cave ordeals barely deter the boys from seeking treasure?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"This suggests people's tendency to suppress rational risk awareness when gripped by greed and ambition. The lure of wealth and glory can blind one to clear mortality signals, causing events to repeat in endless human cycles.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'Does Twain criticize or celebrate the spirit of adventure and imagination embodied by Tom? What implications might this have?',\n",
       "  'completion': \"Twain admires Tom's curiosity and innovative daring, seeing benefits in questioning conventions. But he also warns how blindly romanticizing the defiance of norms and rules threatens moral awareness, making insight, balance and conscience necessary corollaries to progress.\"},\n",
       " {'prompt': 'The text notes Huck finding refuge in a hogshead behind the slaughterhouse after fleeing from the Widow Douglas. What might this symbolize about his character and perspective at this point in the story?',\n",
       "  'completion': 'Huck seeking shelter in a dirty hogshead behind a slaughterhouse vividly encapsulates his aversion to the confines and “refinements” of civilized life with the Widow Douglas. He feels suffocated by the expectations to be clean, proper and regimented - the hogshead represents freedom from societal constraints. It symbolizes how Huck yearns for the simplicity and autonomy of his earlier rough-and-tumble existence compared to the stuffy conventionality imposed on him now. His staunch refusal to rejoin that life, even at Tom’s urging, underscores Huck’s core self-reliance and how he rages against domestication. It also foreshadows his ultimate decision later to light out for the territory rather than conform. Through this, Twain paints a romantic portrait of a wild, unbroken spirit at odds with “civilizing” forces.'}]"

    "#### Loading the Q&A Dataset\n",
    "In this step, we load the organized Q&A dataset and the TF-IDF matrix into memory, preparing the system to answer new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question Matching\n",
    "We implemented a function to find the most similar questions in the dataset using cosine similarity with the TF-IDF matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieve and Return the Answer\n",
    "The script identifies the most similar question in the dataset and retrieves the corresponding answer to respond to new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "From a simple Q&A generation script, we have evolved to a sophisticated system capable of generating context-aware questions and providing answers to new questions based on a comprehensive and organized Q&A dataset. This system leverages the capabilities of the Anthropics Claude model to not only generate Q&A pairs but also to build a knowledge base that can answer questions about the book in a context-aware manner.\n"
