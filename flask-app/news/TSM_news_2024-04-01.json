        "Headline": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (not Named Nvidia) to Buy Right Now",
        "Content": "The AI bull market is here. Stocks are back at all-time highs, thanks largely to a new boom in artificial intelligence (AI).The launch of ChatGPT has set off a race to be a leader in what top CEOs and major investors think will be the next transformative technology, generative AI. Nvidia, which sells the graphics processing unit (GPU) components that are the backbone of the advanced computing systems required for AI, has been the biggest winner so far. However, there are several other stocks primed to be winners as well. Let's take a closer look at two of them.Image source: Getty Images.1. Micron TechnologiesMicron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU) is a leader in memory chips. Historically, its business has been highly cyclical, fluctuating from boom times to busts as the semiconductor industry tends to be sensitive to supply gluts and demand shifts. Just a year ago, the company was operating at a wide loss as coming out of the pandemic, the slowdown in demand for PCs and tablets crushed prices for memory chips.However, Micron is now emerging as a beneficiary of the AI boom as memory chips play a key role in AI servers. As Micron management explained on a recent earnings call, AI server demand is driving growth in high-bandwidth memory, which tightened the supply for the DRAM and NAND chips that Micron specializes in.Because of that trend, the company expects DRAM and NAND prices to increase through calendar 2024. It now expects record revenue and \"much-improved profitability\" in fiscal 2025.CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also said, \"We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society.\" Micron's memory and storage components are valuable in both training and inference functions for AI algorithms, making Micron a likely winner in AI.If the company can generate record revenue in fiscal 2025, it would top the $30.7 billion in revenue it made in fiscal 2022. At that level, Micron would trade at a price-to-sales ratio of around 4, which is an attractive valuation, compared to other AI stocks.Story continuesMicron also has the potential to be highly profitable as its operating margin reached 50% in 2019. If the company's profitability surges, the stock could move a lot higher from here.2. Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingAnother tech stock that seems well-positioned to ride the AI wave is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company, better known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry. It handles manufacturing for many of the world's biggest chip designers, including Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.TSMC has more than a 50% market share of the third-party chip manufacturing industry, giving it tremendous market power in the semiconductor industry more broadly and in AI chips specifically. It handles approximately 90% of the third-party market of advanced chips, which AI models rely on.Because of its virtual monopoly in third-party chip manufacturing, TSMC is more resilient than a company like Nvidia, which needs to maintain its competitive edge and pricing power for the stock to keep gaining. Chip manufacturing has high entry barriers, which makes it unlikely that TSMC's leadership will be challenged in the coming years.Like Micron, TSMC is also emerging from the earlier slump in the semiconductor industry, but its growth is picking up with the help of AI. Through the year's first two months, revenue was up 9.4% and revenue growth accelerated to 11.3%. Investors took this as a sign of AI demand picking up as it was a significant improvement from flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter.TSMC is also highly profitable, further proving its competitive advantages and pricing power. In the fourth quarter, it recorded an operating margin of 41.6%.Finally, TSMC is affordably priced, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and profits are expected to improve as AI provides a tailwind. The chip manufacturing giant was already a rock-solid business, but its economic moat seems poised to widen in the AI era.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "Investors Heavily Search Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "Content": "TSMC (TSM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +5.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 6.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.TSMC is expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.16 points to a change of +18.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.62 indicates a change of +23.7% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for TSMC.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For TSMC, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $85.41 billion and $102.2 billion estimates indicate +23.2% and +19.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTSMC reported revenues of $19.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.44 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.33%. The EPS surprise was +5.11%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.TSMC is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TSMC. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Headline": "Why AST SpaceMobile Stock Jumped Today",
        "Content": "Shares of AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS) rallied as much as 8.4% early Thursday, then settled to close up 1.4% after the satellite designer and manufacturer reached a significant milestone in its efforts to build the world's first space-based cellular broadband network accessible by everyday smartphones.AST readies a first-of-its-kind networkIn a press release late Wednesday, AST SpaceMobile announced it has commenced the \"tape-out phase\" for its Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). In semiconductor manufacturing, the tape-out phase is a critical process that marks the transition from design to actual production.\"As we advance toward the orbital launch of our Block 1 BlueBird satellites in the upcoming months, we are simultaneously making steady progress on the technology underlying our Block 2 satellites,\" explained AST SpaceMobile Chairman and CEO Abel Avellan. \"[...] With the ASIC at the heart of our Block 2 program, we are a big step closer to ushering in a new era of satellite communications, helping to empower people with reliable connectivity, regardless of their location.\"What's next for AST SpaceMobile shareholders?Indeed, AST has spent the past four years in dedicated R&D and engineering, investing $45 million in development for its AST5000 ASIC. The novel, low-power architecture was designed to enable a high-bandwidth, space-based satellite network that will be accessible by everyday smartphones for both commercial and government use. AST has agreements in place with more than 40 mobile network operators around the world totaling over 2 billion subscribers.This tape-out phase won't translate to immediate revenue generation for AST SpaceMobile, of course, but it marks an important milestone for the company as it finally begins to bring its semiconductor designs to life. With AST SpaceMobile shares down around 40% year to date as of this writing, spurred in part as the company had to raise cash earlier this year through a dilutive public share offering, it's no surprise to see shares of the space stock attempting to rebound in response.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in AST SpaceMobile right now?Before you buy stock in AST SpaceMobile, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AST SpaceMobile wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "11 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds",
        "Content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the semiconductor sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Semiconductor Industry OutlookThe semiconductor space is now more exciting than it ever has been before. While 2023 was a year of struggle for most industries, including the semiconductor industry, 2024 promises a growth spurt. This March, KPMG released its Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook for 2024, where it noted some of the key things to look forward to when it comes to semiconductors while highlighting significant challenges posing a threat to this space. KPMG surveyed 172 semiconductor executives for its report, 85% of whom stated that they anticipate the industry to see double-digit revenue growth in 2024. The main growth drivers for the semiconductor industry today continue to be the automotive industry, artificial intelligence, and microprocessors. While these trends and developments continue to propel semiconductors upward, a majority of semiconductor executives believe that there is a lack of skilled talent in the industry, which poses a significant risk to its growth.The Blackwell ChipPerhaps the most significant recent event in the semiconductor industry was the GTC Conference hosted by semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), this March. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, made several major announcements in his keynote at the conference, but perhaps the most anticipated and exciting one was the unveiling of the company's latest chip, the Blackwell, named after David Blackwell, who was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first African American tenured professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In his announcement during his keynote, Huang compared the Blackwell chip to its predecessor, the Hopper, which had been the most advanced GPU in the world before the Blackwell's creation. Huang highlighted that the Blackwell chip comprises 208 billion transistors, followed by these comments on the chip:Story continues\"There's a small line between two dyes. This is the first time two dyes have been abutted like this together, in such a way that the two dyes think it's one chip. There's 10 terabytes of data between it, 10 terabytes per second, so that these two sides of the Blackwell chip have no clue which side they're on. There's no memory locality issues, no cache issues, it's just one giant chip. And so, when we were told that Blackwell's ambitions were beyond the limits of physics, the engineer said 'so what?' And so this is what happened.\"With the introduction of this new chip in the semiconductor space, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has marked itself as the leader in the industry, way ahead of other notable and successful competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a popular semiconductor stock pick for investors for quite some time now, and this popularity is only continuing to expand and grow exponentially.This growth is not limited to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone either - semiconductor companies across the globe are attracting mass amounts of investor attention because of what they have to offer to investors' portfolios in the age of artificial intelligence and new innovations in tech. The only issue that can arise in this arena is skepticism from analysts and investors who may believe that this boom in the semiconductor industry may not last and may, in fact, be creating a lot of unwarranted hype. However, our research shows that several analysts consider several major semiconductor stocks still undervalued compared to their intrinsic worth. As such, we have compiled a list of the best cheap semiconductor stocks to buy. These include some high-growth semiconductor stocks alongside some of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the AI boom.13 Most Advanced Countries in ElectronicsA leading semiconductor chip on a computer robot arm, reflecting the technology advances of the company.Our Methodology\u00a0We compiled our list of the best cheap semiconductor stocks to buy by using a stock screener to identify semiconductor companies with P/E ratios below 25 as of March 27. The stocks were then shortlisted based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

In July, we trimmed our position as its shares rallied ahead of its quarterly report. Then in August, Allegro reported better-than-anticipated results and increased its near-term guidance. However, on the earnings call its management seemed more cautious with the outlook, especially related to volatility for its sales in China, and Allegro\u2019s shares pulled back by -30%. Speaking with management later, we gained a better sense of short-term concerns with China\u2014that comprise less than a quarter of Allegro\u2019s business\u2014and the expected rebound, so we added back to our position.\u201dAllegro MicroSystems, Inc.

        "Headline": "16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In",
        "Content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.If there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).Now, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.So naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.Story continuesYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.NVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:Yes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.Jensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.So, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest InPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology To make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.For these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In16.

        "Headline": "3 AI Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March",
        "Content": "If you've followed the technology sector even the slightest bit over the past year or so, you've noticed the mania for artificial intelligence (AI). It's almost unavoidable at this point.Although recent AI developments pushed it into the mainstream, the technology existed for decades. That said, we're still in the early stages of learning what the technology can truly become, which gives investors a chance to get in on the emerging industry. For investors interested in adding AI-related stocks to their portfolios, the following three companies are great options.1. MicrosoftThere's a strong argument that OpenAI's ChatGPT is the reason that AI has hit the mainstream. After it was released to the public in November 2022, it took just two months or so for ChatGPT to hit 100 million monthly active users. And aside from OpenAI, there was probably no company happier about this than Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).Microsoft and OpenAI have an ongoing partnership that has put Microsoft at the forefront of AI-driven computing capabilities. It began with Microsoft making an initial $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 and has since developed into a full collaboration (and an expanded investment) that mutually benefits both companies.OpenAI gets to use Microsoft's Azure as its cloud computing platform -- which is vital because of the supercomputing power it provides -- and Microsoft gets exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models, which allow it to integrate them into its products and services and boost its competitive advantage.Microsoft's diverse suite of products and services distinguishes it from other tech companies, and adding OpenAI's advanced technologies will only enhance this. It should also positively affect Microsoft's financial results, which have been on an impressive run over the past five years.MSFT Revenue (Quarterly) Chart2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing CompanyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) may not seem like an obvious AI stock, but it's as crucial to the AI pipeline as arguably any other company.Story continuesTo understand TSMC's role in AI, you need to understand how we get to end consumer-facing products like ChatGPT, Bard, and other generative AI applications. For AI to be effective, it must be trained using lots of data -- quantities that must be stored in specialized data centers.Data centers rely on graphic processing units (GPUs), which are essentially the brains of AI computing systems. TSMC and the semiconductors it manufactures for its client companies are crucial in this process. These GPUs rely heavily on TSMC's best-in-class manufacturing processes.This AI domino effect hasn't impacted TSMC's financials yet, but the company's CEO said he expects sales of its AI-related semiconductors to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% for at least the next few years. By 2027, AI-related semiconductors are expected to be responsible for a percentage of the company's revenue in the high teens.TSMC is one of the more important players in bringing AI to life, and its role in that ecosystem can't be easily replicated.3. AmazonAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) relied on AI for a while to supplement its e-commerce business. Its AI systems analyze customers' purchase and search histories, behavior (such as time spent on pages and navigation across pages), and other data to provide personalized shopping recommendations that improve the shopping experience and, ideally, increase its sales.AI long bolstered Amazon's e-commerce business, but recent developments have exposed other parts of the company's business to it, such as its market-leading cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS).AWS is the world's leading cloud computing platform, and it consistently adds AI and machine learning tools that allow users and companies to build their own AI applications. Although e-commerce is Amazon's bread and butter, AWS is its primary profit center and will continue to be for quite some time, particularly as it continues to expand its suite of AI products.Amazon has been investing heavily in its AI capabilities, and it's hard to imagine it will stop soon -- especially because the company's free cash flow has returned to typical levels, giving it the financial flexibility to accelerate its AI research and development.AMZN Free Cash Flow ChartAmazon is a company that has its hand in a lot of different industries, many of which it acts as the leader. As its AI capabilities continue to evolve, it's a company investors will want to be a part of for the long haul.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Headline": "If There Were a \"Magnificent Seven\" Purely for AI Stocks, These Would Be My Top Picks",
        "Content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" includes some of the largest tech-oriented companies. But not every Magnificent Seven component could be considered a true artificial intelligence (AI) play.If there were a new Magnificent Seven purely for AI stocks, then I would keep Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), but swap out Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), and Deere (NYSE: DE).Here's why these seven companies are all excellent ways to invest in AI from various industries.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaThe poster child of the AI craze, Nvidia's growth is mostly due to sales to data centers. Faster and more secure processing power is needed to support complex AI solutions. And that's exactly what Nvidia is giving the industry.The greatest risk to Nvidia is a slowdown in demand from its data center business. Operating income from its compute and networking segment (led by data centers) increased more than sixfold between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.If demand slows, the growth could shrink as fast as it rose. However, an extreme slowdown is unlikely if AI investments pay off for Nvidia's customers.2. Meta PlatformsMeta Platforms plans to spend $10 billion on Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2024. To quote Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the Q4 fiscal 2024 earnings call:Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation, and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.Meta is leveraging AI to boost user engagement, improve its algorithm, and better align ads to interested users. Instagram has become arguably the most valuable digital real estate in the world, and will likely stay that way thanks to Meta's AI investments.Story continues3. MicrosoftThe third and final Magnificent Seven stock that also deserves to be in the AI Magnificent Seven is Microsoft. The company's results show how AI can improve performance and accelerate growth even from established solutions.Microsoft Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot, Azure AI, and more are some of the many ways Microsoft uses AI to improve solutions without breaking what already works.Microsoft makes so much money that it can invest in AI, fund its long-term growth, and still have plenty of cash to buy back stock and raise its dividend. The company is positioned to continue monetizing AI across business-to-business and business-to-consumer platforms.4. Advanced Micro DevicesAMD often traded in tandem with Nvidia, but the company is actually quite different. For one, AMD isn't growing as fast -- yet. However, optimistic investors believe it can unlock explosive growth by competing with Nvidia in the GPU market for AI applications and CPUs for AI-enabled PCs.In 2023, data center revenue grew just 7.5% year over year and made up less than 29% of total revenue. So while AMD's growth is expected to happen, Nvidia's growth is occurring right now.AMD will have to deliver to justify its lofty valuation, but it's certainly one of the most innovative and exciting AI plays out there for risk-tolerant investors.5. Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly known as TSMC, is perhaps the safest way to invest in the AI-fueled semiconductor space.TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, and others. It's a similar dynamic to Apple, which designs its products but relies on its suppliers for materials, manufacturing, and assembly.While these suppliers are usually low-margin, high-volume businesses, TSMC fabs handle some of the most complex and precise workflows in the world. TSMC is compensated accordingly, with an operating margin that has mostly ranged from 35% to 50% over the last decade -- far higher than your typical manufacturer.In this vein, TSMC wins as long as chip demand goes up. It doesn't matter if AMD takes market share from Nvidia, so long as the industry is growing.TSMC is not nearly as expensive as other top chip stocks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.7.TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart6. AdobeIt wasn't long ago that Adobe's growth was slowing. Subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models are great for their consistent revenue. However, innovation and product improvements are needed to retain and grow the customer base, as well as justify price increases. AI has opened the door to some of Adobe's biggest leaps in years.About a year ago, Adobe released Firefly, its generative AI tool for Creative Cloud, and many other products. The impact is already visible in Adobe's numbers, but the company is spending a lot of money to roll out these tools, which is straining profits.Adobe is in customer acquisition mode, hoping to boost Firefly users and grow engagement as quickly as possible. It's a good long-term strategy that focuses on where Adobe could be several years from now, not on where it is today. Patient investors may want to consider buying Adobe now, with the understanding that Wall Street may sell the stock if Adobe puts up weak quarterly results.7. DeereYou may be wondering how we went from hypergrowth chip stocks to a tractor company. Well, part of the reason was to spice up the list with something outside the tech sector. Deere is a sleeper AI play -- and has been for some time now.Deere released its Smart Industrial strategy in 2022. And it's already having an impact on its results. The company is betting that farms will become increasingly automated in the future. Examples would include automated crop spacing, how much fertilizer to use and where, and even a fully autonomous tractor.Buzzwords aside, the idea is to use technology to lower costs and boost crop yield. It doesn't really matter how it's packaged, so long as these tools are boosting business for Deere's customers.AI can benefit farm sustainability and efficiency, and Deere is one of the easiest ways to invest in that trend.Invest in AI in a way that's right for youFrom obvious plays like Nvidia to a well-known legacy brand like Deere, companies across industries are investing in AI to accelerate growth. Every industry is up for disruption. Some changes will happen gradually. Others could happen sooner than expected.The key is investing in what you understand and with a long-term mindset. Companies that are boosting research and development and capital expenditures may not see a return on that investment for some time. Meanwhile, other hot stocks like Nvidia will eventually reach a cyclical slowdown that has nothing to do with the core investment thesis.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "Want Geopolitical Insurance for Your Semiconductor Investments? Buy This Stock",
        "Content": "As one examines the landscape of the semiconductor industry, it becomes hard to escape its sensitivity to some geopolitical events.According to a recent Congressional Research Service report, approximately 35% of global wafer fabrication capacity for all logic chips resided in Taiwan in 2020. In addition, a joint report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) says that Taiwan accounts for a whopping 92% of wafer fabrication capacity for advanced logic chips -- chips manufactured using a technology process of under 10nm -- globally.The leading wafer fabrication company in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), counts the likes of Nvidia, Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm among its major clients.The risks created by that concentration are made worse by China's threats to invade Taiwan. While one can cite valid reasons why that will not happen, the possible consequences of such an event make it prudent for investors to hedge against such a possibility. Given the state of the industry, the hedge of choice is likely Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock.Why Intel makes an excellent hedgeAdmittedly, choosing Intel may seem counterintuitive on some levels. For one, TSMC became dominant in part because Intel lost its technical lead in chip manufacturing in the 2010s. Moreover, most market observers perceive Samsung as a more technologically advanced manufacturer than Intel.However, Samsung does not trade on U.S. exchanges. Also, the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF invests 23% of its assets in Samsung, giving it limited value as a hedge.By contrast, Intel stands out because it operates more fabs on U.S. soil than any other company. If sourcing chips from Taiwan at some point ceases to be an option, Intel's facilities will become more valuable to its fabless peers. That could increase Intel's appeal if other semiconductor stocks faced uncertainty.Also, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel has opened its manufacturing facilities to its competitors by launching Intel Foundry Services. It already counts Nvidia, Boeing, and the U.S. government among its client base, and as Intel Foundry Services improves its capabilities, more prospective customers will likely turn to it.Story continuesAdditionally, it is spending $100 billion to expand its production capacity in four U.S. states and an additional 33 billion euros ($36 billion) to construct foundries in the European Union. Part of the $100 billion it will spend domestically will come from funds distributed by the U.S. government under the CHIPS Act, an initiative to incentivize chip production in the U.S. Intel is receiving an $8.5 billion grant from the Commerce Department, will receive a tax credit of up to 25% on the money it spends to boost chip production, and is eligible for up to $11 billion in federal loans.Furthermore, Intel has bolstered its competitiveness by buying high-NA EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines -- the most advanced semiconductor production equipment on the market -- from ASML. Such machines will help Intel compete with TSMC and Samsung, and help it fulfill its pledges to regain the technical lead by 2025 and become the No. 2 foundry by 2030.The state of Intel's stockThe company's moves to grow its capacity and upgrade its technological capabilities should pay off in time, which in turn should bolster Intel's stock price. Nonetheless, those will be longer-term tailwinds. Amid the recent slump in the chip industry (at least, outside the AI chip niche), Intel's 2023 revenue fell by 14% to $54 billion.Despite that decline, the company's revenue picture is likely improving as its top line grew 10% year over year in Q4. Also, revenue from Intel Foundry Services rose by 103% in 2023 to $952 million, an early sign of success for that business segment.Moreover, the profit picture reflected the same trends. Net income suffered a brutal 83% drop to $1.7 billion in 2023. However, its $2.7 billion profit in Q4 points to the likelihood of a significant rebound in 2024.With that anticipated recovery, Intel trades at a forward P/E ratio of 31. That's a more expensive valuation than TSMC, but a cheaper one than design companies such as AMD or Nvidia. Arguably, Intel is trading at a fair valuation level.INTC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.Moving forward with IntelUltimately, a fair valuation and Intel's fab footprint outside of Taiwan are excellent reasons for semiconductor investors to think of Intel's stock as \"insurance.\"Intel still has much to prove before it can reclaim a leadership position in its industry. Yet even under a worst-case scenario, its significant production capacity outside of Taiwan will increase the chipmaker's importance.Moreover, Intel stock could perform well in a world in which geopolitical tensions have eased. The growth of Intel Foundry Services, thanks to its improving and expanding capacity, should make Intel more competitive and increasingly able to meet the needs of fabless chip companies. If investors stay patient, they could win with Intel stock regardless of world events.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.
