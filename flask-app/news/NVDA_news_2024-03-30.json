        "Headline": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (not Named Nvidia) to Buy Right Now",
        "Content": "The AI bull market is here. Stocks are back at all-time highs, thanks largely to a new boom in artificial intelligence (AI).The launch of ChatGPT has set off a race to be a leader in what top CEOs and major investors think will be the next transformative technology, generative AI. Nvidia, which sells the graphics processing unit (GPU) components that are the backbone of the advanced computing systems required for AI, has been the biggest winner so far. However, there are several other stocks primed to be winners as well. Let's take a closer look at two of them.Image source: Getty Images.1. Micron TechnologiesMicron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU) is a leader in memory chips. Historically, its business has been highly cyclical, fluctuating from boom times to busts as the semiconductor industry tends to be sensitive to supply gluts and demand shifts. Just a year ago, the company was operating at a wide loss as coming out of the pandemic, the slowdown in demand for PCs and tablets crushed prices for memory chips.However, Micron is now emerging as a beneficiary of the AI boom as memory chips play a key role in AI servers. As Micron management explained on a recent earnings call, AI server demand is driving growth in high-bandwidth memory, which tightened the supply for the DRAM and NAND chips that Micron specializes in.Because of that trend, the company expects DRAM and NAND prices to increase through calendar 2024. It now expects record revenue and \"much-improved profitability\" in fiscal 2025.CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also said, \"We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society.\" Micron's memory and storage components are valuable in both training and inference functions for AI algorithms, making Micron a likely winner in AI.If the company can generate record revenue in fiscal 2025, it would top the $30.7 billion in revenue it made in fiscal 2022. At that level, Micron would trade at a price-to-sales ratio of around 4, which is an attractive valuation, compared to other AI stocks.Story continuesMicron also has the potential to be highly profitable as its operating margin reached 50% in 2019. If the company's profitability surges, the stock could move a lot higher from here.2. Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingAnother tech stock that seems well-positioned to ride the AI wave is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company, better known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry. It handles manufacturing for many of the world's biggest chip designers, including Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.TSMC has more than a 50% market share of the third-party chip manufacturing industry, giving it tremendous market power in the semiconductor industry more broadly and in AI chips specifically. It handles approximately 90% of the third-party market of advanced chips, which AI models rely on.Because of its virtual monopoly in third-party chip manufacturing, TSMC is more resilient than a company like Nvidia, which needs to maintain its competitive edge and pricing power for the stock to keep gaining. Chip manufacturing has high entry barriers, which makes it unlikely that TSMC's leadership will be challenged in the coming years.Like Micron, TSMC is also emerging from the earlier slump in the semiconductor industry, but its growth is picking up with the help of AI. Through the year's first two months, revenue was up 9.4% and revenue growth accelerated to 11.3%. Investors took this as a sign of AI demand picking up as it was a significant improvement from flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter.TSMC is also highly profitable, further proving its competitive advantages and pricing power. In the fourth quarter, it recorded an operating margin of 41.6%.Finally, TSMC is affordably priced, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and profits are expected to improve as AI provides a tailwind. The chip manufacturing giant was already a rock-solid business, but its economic moat seems poised to widen in the AI era.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\u00a0When interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invesco predicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.During economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanley suggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.Story continuesAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\u00a0\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201dSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Despite hurdles, Apple aims to strengthen its presence in China, which is a crucial market. Chinese companies like ByteDance have already introduced apps for Vision Pro outside China, indicating potential for further collaborations.According to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the last quarter.\u00a0Horizon Kinetics stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cThe full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise \u2013 perhaps even shock \u2013 to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China\u2019s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)11.

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals\u2014Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.Or how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year\u2019s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel\u2019s semiconductor \u201cfabs\u201d in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.\u201d10. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 27: 94.08%iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 10th on our list of the best growth ETFs.

As of March 26, 2024, the fund\u2019s net assets exceed $44 billion, featuring an expense ratio of 0.18%. Its portfolio consists of 227 stocks. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is one of the best growth ETFs to buy.\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cNetflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2014both categorized in the communication services sector\u2014rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.With regard to Meta, the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year\u2019s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta\u2019s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.\u201d8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cIn early 2023, we initiated an investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company\u2019s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.Since we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google\u2019s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)7.

The company generates over half of its revenue in the U.S. from its top-selling drugs Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz. The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.Eli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.\u201d6.
