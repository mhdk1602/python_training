        "Headline": "AMD Stock Is Down 15% From Its 52-Week Highs, and Here's Why You Should Buy It",
        "Content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock price hit a 52-week high on March 8, but shares of the chipmaker have pulled back more than 15% since then, even though there has been no notable company-specific development in the interim.Of course, reports that China is reportedly planning to replace chips made by AMD and Intel from Chinese government servers and personal computers (PCs) did weigh briefly on the stock price, but even that shouldn't be a big problem for AMD in the long run. Here's why.Sanctions in China shouldn't be much of a trouble for AMDAMD reportedly gets 15% of its total revenue from selling its chips to China. So, any sanctions on sales of its chips in that country may have an impact on AMD's financials. However, the dynamics of the semiconductor market are such that even if AMD is unable to sell its chips in China, it will have other avenues to sell them.For instance, sales of both servers and PCs are expected to grow strongly across the globe thanks to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Sales of PCs fell just 2.7% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the 14% drop for the entire year. The market is set to witness a turnaround in 2024, driven by a new refresh cycle in the enterprise and education markets, as well as the arrival of AI-enabled PCs.Market research firm Canalys estimates that 48 million AI PCs could be shipped this year, accounting for 18% of the overall market. What's more, shipments of AI PCs could grow at an annual rate of 44% through 2028 and account for 70% of the overall market. Canalys also points out that AI PCs are likely to command a 10% to 15% premium as compared to traditional machines.AMD, therefore, has an opportunity to boost both its volumes and average selling price (ASP) of central processing units (CPUs). It is also worth noting that AMD has been taking share from Intel in the PC market. The company controlled 20.2% of the client CPU market in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from 17.1% in the year-ago period, as per Mercury Research.Story continuesMercury Research attributed the share gains to AMD's early move into the market for AI PCs with its Ryzen 7040 processor. Meanwhile, AMD claims that its CPUs are powering over 90% of AI PCs currently in the market. So, the stronger demand for AI PCs is going to give AMD's client processor business a nice shot in the arm.Something similar is likely to unfold in the server CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) markets. AMD finished 2023 with 23% of the server CPU market under its control, up from 17.6% in the year-ago period. AMD CEO Lisa Su remarked on the latest earnings conference call that the company is witnessing \"robust demand for EPYC server CPUs across cloud, enterprise, and AI customers.\"AMD also added that \"a growing number of customers are adopting EPYC CPUs for inferencing workloads.\" The good part is that AMD's server CPU momentum is here to stay, as the market for AI servers is predicted to clock 26% annual growth through 2029. On the other hand, AMD saw stronger-than-expected demand for its AI GPUs as well.AMD increased its full-year revenue forecast from data center GPUs to $3.5 billion from the earlier estimate of $2 billion. However, management made it clear on the earnings call that it could very well exceed that mark because of an improving supply chain that will help it meet additional demand. All this indicates that AMD is well-placed to trump analysts' expectations in the coming quarters.AMD could surprise investors with stronger-than-expected growthWhen AMD released fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan. 30, 2024, the company guided for $5.4 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 at the midpoint. That would be nearly flat from the prior-year period's revenue of $5.35 billion. Additionally, AMD's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin guidance of 52% for the current quarter would be a slight improvement over the year-ago quarter's reading of 50%.AMD's revenue and earnings, therefore, could increase slightly in Q1. Analysts, however, expect AMD to post $5 billion in quarterly revenue, which is lower than what the company has guided for. Additionally, consensus estimates forecast a decline in AMD's earnings to $0.55 per share from $0.60 per share in the year-ago period.However, there is a solid chance that AMD could beat the market's expectations by a big margin because of the multiple AI-related tailwinds discussed above. The good part is that AMD's pullback has made the stock cheaper than before. This is evident from the chart:AMD PE Ratio (Forward) ChartAMD is now trading at 49 times forward earnings and has a price-to-sales ratio of less than 13. It was trading at more than 57 times forward earnings and 15 times sales earlier this month. Savvy investors can consider using this drop to accumulate AMD stock as the above-mentioned growth drivers could help it regain its mojo, and the turnaround could begin as soon as next month when it releases its first-quarter 2024 results.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "11 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds",
        "Content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the semiconductor sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Semiconductor Industry OutlookThe semiconductor space is now more exciting than it ever has been before. While 2023 was a year of struggle for most industries, including the semiconductor industry, 2024 promises a growth spurt. This March, KPMG released its Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook for 2024, where it noted some of the key things to look forward to when it comes to semiconductors while highlighting significant challenges posing a threat to this space. KPMG surveyed 172 semiconductor executives for its report, 85% of whom stated that they anticipate the industry to see double-digit revenue growth in 2024. The main growth drivers for the semiconductor industry today continue to be the automotive industry, artificial intelligence, and microprocessors. While these trends and developments continue to propel semiconductors upward, a majority of semiconductor executives believe that there is a lack of skilled talent in the industry, which poses a significant risk to its growth.The Blackwell ChipPerhaps the most significant recent event in the semiconductor industry was the GTC Conference hosted by semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), this March. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, made several major announcements in his keynote at the conference, but perhaps the most anticipated and exciting one was the unveiling of the company's latest chip, the Blackwell, named after David Blackwell, who was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first African American tenured professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In his announcement during his keynote, Huang compared the Blackwell chip to its predecessor, the Hopper, which had been the most advanced GPU in the world before the Blackwell's creation. Huang highlighted that the Blackwell chip comprises 208 billion transistors, followed by these comments on the chip:Story continues\"There's a small line between two dyes. This is the first time two dyes have been abutted like this together, in such a way that the two dyes think it's one chip. There's 10 terabytes of data between it, 10 terabytes per second, so that these two sides of the Blackwell chip have no clue which side they're on. There's no memory locality issues, no cache issues, it's just one giant chip. And so, when we were told that Blackwell's ambitions were beyond the limits of physics, the engineer said 'so what?' And so this is what happened.\"With the introduction of this new chip in the semiconductor space, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has marked itself as the leader in the industry, way ahead of other notable and successful competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a popular semiconductor stock pick for investors for quite some time now, and this popularity is only continuing to expand and grow exponentially.This growth is not limited to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone either - semiconductor companies across the globe are attracting mass amounts of investor attention because of what they have to offer to investors' portfolios in the age of artificial intelligence and new innovations in tech. The only issue that can arise in this arena is skepticism from analysts and investors who may believe that this boom in the semiconductor industry may not last and may, in fact, be creating a lot of unwarranted hype. However, our research shows that several analysts consider several major semiconductor stocks still undervalued compared to their intrinsic worth. As such, we have compiled a list of the best cheap semiconductor stocks to buy. These include some high-growth semiconductor stocks alongside some of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the AI boom.13 Most Advanced Countries in ElectronicsA leading semiconductor chip on a computer robot arm, reflecting the technology advances of the company.Our Methodology\u00a0We compiled our list of the best cheap semiconductor stocks to buy by using a stock screener to identify semiconductor companies with P/E ratios below 25 as of March 27.

        "Content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best 5G stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more such companies, go directly to the 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.While artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominating headlines, another technological advancement is quietly gaining momentum and warrants investors' attention: 5G technology. Representing the next generation of mobile internet, 5G is poised to replace 4G, offering ultra-fast speeds and significantly lower latency, enhancing communication time between devices.Ericsson, a telecommunications company, stated in its mobility report that by 2028, 5G will emerge as the primary mobile access technology by subscription. Globally, 5G subscriptions are expected to surpass 5.3 billion in 2029, constituting 58% of all mobile subscriptions at that point. Further projections indicate that by 2029, North America and the GCC will boast the highest 5G penetration at 92%, followed closely by Western Europe at 85%.Of course, while the penetration of 5G connectivity is expected to open up new growth opportunities in both hardware and software sectors, a 2020 report by Edward Jones highlighted that the full realization of 5G may take considerable time due to the complexity of its technical infrastructure requirements. The report emphasized that the deployment of 5G would not reach completion levels until software developers conduct extensive testing and exploration to determine the most effective utilization of the high speeds and responsiveness unlocked by 5G technology. Consumer sentiment echoes this observation, with many 5G smartphone users indicating that their devices have yet to fully leverage the capabilities of the technology. Deloitte's research reveals that a significant majority (53%) of 5G smartphone users are actively looking for applications and experiences that can harness the advanced capabilities of the network. Additionally, a notable 26% expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of innovative apps and services specifically designed for the 5G environment.Story continuesHowever, investors should take note that despite the short-term headwinds in the 5G sector, such as those experienced by Nokia this past year, the economic benefits of the 5G revolution are expected to be far and wide. Grand View Research projects that the 5G services market will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 59.4% from 2023 to 2030. This growth trajectory is anticipated to be driven b y the convergence of other sub-sectors of technology, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and high-speed data connectivity, which collectively will catalyze market expansion.Investors looking to capitalize on the potential of 5G should adopt a diversified strategy by investing in various sectors of the 5G ecosystem. This includes companies involved in providing 5G network equipment, tower infrastructure, semiconductors, hyperscalers, and mobile network operators. In that regard, some of the best 5G stocks to buy include the likes of\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media.\u00a0The United States economy has been hit hard by inflation concerns in the past two years, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates in a bid to curb surging prices. Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\u00a0Coupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\u00a0Despite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy. Benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have rocketed since the start of the new year. The former is up nearly 9% year-to-date and the latter has grown by more than 10%. Key stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also surging, the first two registering returns of 10.3% and 92% since the turn of the year.\u00a0Story continuesA prominent theme for growth this year is artificial intelligence. Jensen Huang, the CEO of chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently highlighted the steps that the firm was taking to emerge as a leader in this space. During the fourth quarter earnings call, Huang called the present AI boom an inflection point that had triggered a sense of urgency at the enterprise level to develop strategies in the AI world. He cautioned, however, that the AI supercomputer infrastructure and model algorithms remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.\u201cI want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds.

Here is what the fund said:\u201cOther bottom contributors included Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Carrier Global and Becton, Dickinson.

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a financial services holding company that provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions. On February 14, investment advisory Piper Sandler upgraded Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock to Overweight from Neutral and raised the price target to $63 from $56.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 87 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), compared to 79 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Silver Beech Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cCitigroup (\u201cCiti\u201d) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in \u201cbucket 3 or 4\u201d of the \u201cglobal systemically important bank\u201d (\u201cG-SIB\u201d) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi\u2019s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi\u2019s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company\u2019s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.Citi\u2019s market perception suffers from the bank\u2019s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest \u201cbailout\u201d) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon\u2019s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi\u2019s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi\u2019s overall performance\u2026\u201d (Click here to see the full text)15. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) makes and sells networking and other products. On February 15, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\u00a0At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\u201cCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.\u201d14. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105 \u00a0Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) operates as a diversified software company worldwide. On January 2, investment advisory Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock and raised the price target to $705 from $650.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 4.5 million shares worth more than $2.7 billion.\u00a0In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cBoth Alphabet and Adobe\u2019s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.\u201d13. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 162Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based payments technology firm. On January 27, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and raised the price target to $319 from $304.\u00a0At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $26.5 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 167 in the preceding quarter worth $24.4 billion.\u00a0In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cMastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble\u2019s clients, we occasionally tell them that we\u2019re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Most people carry both.People carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they\u2019ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren\u2019t going to get paid\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)12. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83\u00a0Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides travel and restaurant online reservation and related services worldwide. On February 26, investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock and raised the price target to $4,100 from $3,677.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), compared to 81 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion.\u00a0In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u00a0\u201cBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking\u2019s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as \u201cplan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.\u201d The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing \u201cMy budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.\u201dBooking\u2019s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company\u2019s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking\u2019s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking\u2019s AI Trip planner has access to the company\u2019s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.\u201d11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor firm. On March 7, investment advisory Mizuho maintained a Buy rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and raised the price target to $235 from $200.\u00a0Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 28 million shares worth more than $4.1 billion.\u00a0In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u00a0\u201cOn the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we\u2019ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it\u2019s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We\u2019ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we\u2019re trying to \u201clet winners run\u201d while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.\u201d10. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

On March 4, investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock with a price target of $45.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) with 11.6 million shares worth more than $334 million.\u00a0In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cAmong our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.\u201d8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 242\u00a0Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 in the preceding quarter worth $35 billion.\u00a0In its Q4 2023 investor letter, SaltLight Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) primary mission is all about capitalising on user engagement and maintaining its network effects. AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)Improving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you\u2019re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you\u2019re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these \u2018digital billboards\u2019 are a finite resource \u2013 only more engagement time creates them.And here\u2019s where the magic of \u2018AI job one\u2019 comes in \u2013 finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked \u2013 thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cAs for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc., (META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.\u201d6. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

        "Content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.Growth Outperforms in 2023 and BeyondInvesting in growth stocks is a good way to bolster your portfolio with high-profit names. Traditionally, growth stocks are companies that quickly grow their sales and earnings relative to the market, making them highly attractive to investors. But on the flipside, these stocks typically have incredibly high valuations and P/E ratios, which may discourage some investors looking for less expensive stocks. However, if you're an investor who is willing to commit to a higher valuation in exchange for quick profits and gains, growth stocks may be the best for you.Last year, growth stocks outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin. According to a Bloomberg article published this January, the S&P 500 Growth Index actually saw gains of 30% for 2023 compared to the broader benchmark index's 22% gain for the year. This performance came as a shock to many investors, considering the fact that the Federal Reserve was on a rate-hiking journey for most of the year, and traditionally, growth is expected to underperform in periods of rising interest rates. This stellar performance has resulted in growth stocks acquiring somewhat of a reliable appearance, leading to many investors in 2024 continuing to stick with their growth picks over their value counterparts.For example, UBP's Head of Equity Research for Asia, Kieran Calder, joined Bloomberg on January 3 and stated that US growth stocks are at present a \"better bet\" for investors, with Calder himself preferring growth over value stocks in 2024. One of the major growth sectors in the market today is the technology sector with its exponential growth in light of the rise of artificial intelligence. According to Calder, for investors today, the following are the places to be in high-growth tech:Story continues\"One is the Magnificent Seven, and we think these should probably be core holdings in a portfolio, but we also expect kind of a broadening out into, let's say, software names within tech, which have underperformed over the court of last year. But we'll be able to use and get improved earnings on the back of implementation of AI, for example, and more cloud adoption. So we think that the second tier of cloud and AI names is a good place to start to look for more ideas within US tech.\"In keeping with the above, our list of the best growth stocks to buy today also has several major tech names in it, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). For growth investors looking to identify key investment areas within tech, it would be necessary to first identify the main themes within the tech sector in terms of what will drive the sector's growth the most in 2024 and beyond. According to BlackRock Active Equity Group's Ben Bei, there are three major themes in this sector: AI, cloud computing, and electric and autonomous vehicles. These areas offer the most interesting investment opportunities for investors today and are thus worth taking a look at.Small-Cap Growth Stocks On The RiseWhen most investors think about growth stocks, especially in the tech sector, what comes to mind is usually large or mega-cap stocks with enormous valuations and market capitalizations. However, the trend in growth stock performance this year is showing that even small-cap growth stocks are on the rise and are performing spectacularly. On February 29, Fairlead Strategies' Founder and Managing Partner, Katie Stockton, joined CNBC's \"Last Call\" to offer some insights on this development. Here's what she said:\"We've seen very concentrated outperformance in the small-cap arena from growth stocks, so more than just Supermicro and Viking Therapeutics. We have broad participation from growth more broadly and that includes a lot of biotechnology stocks, a lot of technology stocks, and I actually see that as a risk on move. A risk on indication shows an appetite for these names that previously were out of favor. You could say that about even the Russell 2000 Index, that the small-cap benchmark had been out of favor for some time. And now it's showing some signs of life and relative strength, when you compare it to the S&P 500.\"This improvement in the performance of small-cap growth stocks alongside the usual suspects is proving to be encouraging for investors. As such, many investors are looking for some of the best growth stocks to buy, which is why we have compiled our list below. Our list of the best growth stocks includes some of the best stocks for long-term growth and some of the fastest growing technology companies in the US today.10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In NowA close-up of a portfolio of stocks, emphasizing the broad equity portfolio of the company.Our MethodologyFor our list of the best growth stocks to invest in now, we consulted the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF.
