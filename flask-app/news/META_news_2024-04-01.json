If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\u00a0When interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invesco predicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.During economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanley suggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.Story continuesAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\u00a0\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201dSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cThe full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals\u2014Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.Or how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year\u2019s projected revenue.

(NASDAQ:META)\u2014both categorized in the communication services sector\u2014rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.With regard to Meta, the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year\u2019s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta\u2019s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.\u201d8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cIn early 2023, we initiated an investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company\u2019s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.Since we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google\u2019s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023.

In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)7.

The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.Eli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.\u201d6.

        "Headline": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Ranked From Best to Worst Performance Over Time",
        "Content": "The S&P 500 roared higher over the past year or so from its bear market low to a new all-time high -- and this movement confirmed the market has indeed shifted into bull territory. The gains weren't exactly broad-based though. Stocks dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- drove gains as they soared in the double or triple digits last year.Of course, that's just a short-term increase. But these stocks have proven themselves over a longer period too. Let's take a look at the performance of each of these players over the past five years and see if they still represent compelling buy stories. Here they are, ranked from best to worst, according to performance.Image source: Getty Images.1. Nvidia, up 1,950%Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and share price growth truly took off thanks to its crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used to be best known for their role in gaming -- but the ability to rapidly process many tasks simultaneously made Nvidia's GPUs a perfect fit for AI.Today, Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI chip market, and that's not likely to change as the company invests heavily to stay ahead of rivals. This tech giant just recently announced its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips ever, set for release later this year.2. Tesla, up 881%Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings and share price performance actually have slowed in recent times as various factors weigh on the electric vehicle giant -- from higher costs linked to production ramp-ups to negative foreign exchange impact.But Tesla surged over the past five years as the company delivered more and more vehicles, opened major new factories, delivered record earnings, and built up more than $29 billion in cash. The cash level is particularly important because it will help this ambitious EV leader continue to innovate and potentially progress on programs such as self-driving technology.Story continuesSo, Tesla's slowdown looks like a temporary situation, meaning growth probably isn't over for this market giant.3. Apple, up 268%Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) brand strength has helped it keep users coming back to world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac -- and even continue to attract new customers. This has made Apple the go-to stock for the technology investor seeking growth and safety. The company even won over billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has almost half of his portfolio invested in the tech giant.Some may worry that Apple's growth could plateau at a certain point, but one particular thing makes me confident that won't happen. The company's services -- sold to its growing user base -- have taken off, with services revenue reaching records. And this could drive a whole new era of growth for Apple.4. Microsoft, up 260%Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), like Apple, is a classic tech company that's proven its strength over the long haul. But in recent times, Microsoft also has shown its ability to seize a growth opportunity. The company was an early believer in AI, investing $1 billion in OpenAI, the developer of chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019.The tech powerhouse later extended the partnership and increased its investment, a move that also strengthened the company's cloud business, Azure. This business offers a wide variety of AI tools and has seen its revenue growth soar, rising 30% in the most recent period -- surpassing that of rivals Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Their revenue advanced 13% and 26%, respectively.So, Microsoft clearly could be a winner in the potential AI revolution.5. Meta Platforms, up 197%Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) went through a period of cost cutting in recent times, but at the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned for the next step for this social media giant. And that's building up strengths in AI. The company has gone all in on that, developing its own large language model and aiming to apply AI across its products and services.On top of that, Meta's dominance in social media is unwavering, a key point since it, through advertising, brings in most of the company's revenue. It's easy to imagine AI further boosting the company's social media platforms and driving more growth.6. Alphabet, up 159%Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has an extremely solid moat, or competitive advantage, in the business that brings in the lion's share of its revenue. And that's Google Search, which holds more than 90% of the global search market. This has kept advertisers coming back, even during recent times of higher inflation.Today, Alphabet, like many of these Magnificent Seven companies, is investing in AI, and this technology is helping it to make search faster and better. This, along with AI offerings through Google Cloud, may power earnings growth in the coming years.7. Amazon, up 103%Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed during the early days of the pandemic as customers flocked to e-commerce -- but a couple of years later, higher inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and the wallets of its customers. And that hurt stock performance, making Amazon the worst-performing of the Magnificent Seven over the past five years (though a 100% gain isn't something to frown about).But the company revamped its cost structure\u00a0and shifted from an annual loss in 2022 to solid profit in 2023, and the shares went on to gain. And this may continue thanks to Amazon's focus on AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its own operations and selling AI products and services through AWS, the world's cloud services leader.Are the Magnificent Seven stocks buys today?Now, let's get back to our question: Do these high-flying stocks still represent compelling buys? As you can see in the chart, they remain reasonably priced in relation to forward earnings estimates if you consider the long-term growth prospects of each of these players.AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) ChartTesla is the most expensive by this measure, but these figures consider potential earnings next year -- which is rather short term. The EV giant's moves today to lower the costs of producing its vehicles and incorporate AI in its processes could pay off over the coming years, making today's valuation look fair. Still, other players like Alphabet or Meta clearly are cheap and may represent an even better buying opportunity right now.And here's one important thing to note: Some of these companies went through rough patches in recent times, yet they still managed to deliver big gains over a five-year period. This is a great example of the power of long-term investing, which implies holding on to a stock for at least five years.All of this means it's not too late to get in on some or all of the Magnificent Seven, a group of quality stocks that could continue to deliver top returns over the long haul.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "Do These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Have the Best Business Models Ever?",
        "Content": "Over long periods of time -- I'm talking five to 10 years at least -- often it's the highest-quality businesses that perform the best for shareholders. There are numerous examples of companies that can consistently grow revenue and profits that ultimately drive their stock higher.With that in mind, investors should try to identify these types of elite companies. Luckily, you don't have to look too far. There are two well-known \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that might operate the best business models ever.Let's look at these companies and their current investment merits.Internet platformsThe rise of the internet spawned many new businesses that helped change the economy. But there are two that really stand out.I'm talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Since their initial public offerings (IPOs), what were formerly known as Google and Facebook, respectively, have each crushed the broader Nasdaq Composite Index.Why do they have superior business models? Both companies are internet platforms that benefit from powerful network effects in winner-take-all markets.Meta owns various social media apps that combined have 4 billion monthly active users. The business doesn't create any content itself; it simply connects users and collects ad revenue. It's a platform for human connection.Alphabet's key segment, Google Search, which generated 57% of total company revenue in 2023, had 163 billion visitors February. It also doesn't create content, but connects users with the information they seek while it collects ad revenue. This is a platform for the organization of information.What's special about these companies is that because of network effects, they get better for all stakeholders over time. This makes it impossible for smaller rivals to effectively compete. Who wants to sign up for a social media app that barely has any users? And who wants to use a search engine that won't give you the answers you're looking for?Story continuesGiven that everyone wants to be on the social media app that everyone else is on, there's a winner-take-all dynamic where the top service will attract the vast majority of users. The same situation applies with Google Search. People want to use the service that is the best at matching search queries with the right information across the internet. Given its monopoly-like global market share of 92%, Google Search dominates in this regard.Because there is virtually unlimited \"real estate\" across the internet, since there will be more users who spend more time on the internet, these two businesses have a tailwind working in their favor to generate greater digital ad revenue over time.Should you buy Alphabet and Meta?In the last 12 months, shares of Alphabet and Meta soared 43% and 140%, respectively. Yet they still look like smart stocks to buy right now. Alphabet shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.2, while Meta's sell for a multiple of 24.7. These are reasonable valuations.According to Wall Street analyst estimates, over the next three years, both companies are expected to grow their earnings per share by the high teens at the least. Should these forecasts come to fruition, it will certainly lift their share prices.Combined, Alphabet and Meta generated $112 billion of free cash flow in 2023. That gives them unrivaled capacity to invest aggressively behind artificial intelligence initiatives to make their various services even better for users and advertisers. Plus, this cash is used to consistently repurchase outstanding shares.Investors don't need to overthink this. These two top businesses deserve your savings.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "Georgia joins states seeking parental permission before children join social media",
        "Content": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia could join other states in requiring children younger than 16 to have their parents\u2019 explicit permission to create social media accounts.Lawmakers on Friday gave final approval to Senate Bill 351, which also would ban social media use on school devices and internet services, require porn sites to verify users are 18 or over and mandate additional education by schools on social media and internet use. The House passed the measure 120-45 and the Senate approved it 48-7.The bill, which Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte of Dallas called \u201ctransformative,\u201d now goes to Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature or veto.A number of other states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Utah passed laws last year requiring parental consent for children to use social media. In Arkansas, a federal judge in August blocked enforcement of a law requiring parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts.Some in Congress also are proposing parental consent for minors.State Rep. Scott Hilton, a Peachtree Corners Republican, argued the state should do more to limit social media use by children, saying it's causing harm.\u201cEvery rose has a thorn, and that\u2019s social media in this generation,\" Hilton said. \"It\u2019s great for connectivity and activism, but it has reared its ugly head on mental health.\u201dBut opponents warned the bill would cause problems. For example, Rep. David Wilkerson, a Powder Springs Democrat, said that the ban on use of social media in schools could ban teachers from showing educationally valuable YouTube videos.\u201cIf we do pass this, we\u2019ll be back fixing this next year, because there are too many issues with this bill,\" Wilkerson said.The bill says social media services would have to use \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d to verify someone's age by July 1, 2025.Services would have to treat anyone who can't be verified as a minor. Parents of children younger than 16 would have to consent to their children joining a service. Social medial companies would be limited in how they could customize ads for children younger than 16 and how much information they could collect on those children.Story continuesTo comply with federal regulation, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms, but children have been shown to easily evade the bans.Up to 95% of teens aged 13 to 17 report using a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use them \u201calmost constantly,\u201d the Pew Research Center found.The Georgia bill also aims to shut down porn sites by requiring submission of a digitized identification card or some other government-issued identification. Companies could be held liable if minors were found to access the sites, and could face fines of up to $10,000.\u201cIt will protect our children,\" said Rep. Rick Jasperse, a Jasper Republican who argues age verification will lead porn sites to cut off access to Georgians. In March, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Texas law, leading Pornhub to cut off access to Texans.The Free Speech Coalition, which represents adult film makers, says the bill would be ineffective because users could mask their location and because people would be forced to transmit sensitive information. They also argue it's unconstitutional because there are less restrictive ways to keep children out and discriminate against certain types of speech. The coalition has sued multiple states over the laws.The ban on school social media excludes email, news, gaming, online shopping, photograph editing and academic sites. The measure also requires a model program on the effects of social media and for students in grades 6-12, and requires existing anti-bullying programs to be updated.The move comes after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in May that social media hasn\u2019t been proven to be safe for young people.Murthy called on tech companies, parents and caregivers to take \u201cimmediate action to protect kids now\" and asked tech companies to share data and increase transparency and for policymakers to regulate social media for safety the way they do car seats and baby formula.Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instragram, announced in 2022 it was taking steps to verify ages. Meta says it provides \u201cage-appropriate experiences\u201d for teens 13-17 on Instagram, including preventing unwanted contact from unknown adults.Dozens of U.S. states, including California and New York, also are suing Meta Platforms Inc., claiming the company harms young people and contributes to a youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.Florida recently passed a law banning social media accounts for children under 14 regardless of parental consent and require parental permission for 14- and 15-year-olds."

These changes, which limit the reach of political content from accounts users don't already follow, are enacted by default. If you're already wondering how to get that kind of content back into your feed, you can follow our guide on changing Instagram's political settings here.Meta has made an effort to decrease the reach of news and political content across its platforms, especially in regards to content that is algorithmically recommended versus being surfaced from a direct connection to an individual or account. Threads will host, but not \"amplify\" news, per remarks from its head Adam Mosseri last year. And Facebook is shutting down the News Tab as it continues to block news content in Canada in an ongoing dispute with legislation requiring platforms to pay publishers for content.And which posts and topics will Instagram actually deem to be political? The answer, as expected, is both far-reaching and vague, covering anything \u201cpotentially related to things like laws, elections, or social topics.\u201d As for why these changes have gone into effect, and what it says about Meta's priorities across its wide-ranging social empire, well, you'll have to give today's episode a look.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/techcrunch-minute-youre-likely-seeing-less-news-and-politics-on-instagram-heres-why/"
