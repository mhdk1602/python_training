        "Content": "Google is shutting down its Podcasts app in the U.S. in a matter of days. The company has begun warning the app's users they will need to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music by April 2 to follow and stream their favorite shows going forward. Users who don't make the move immediately will still have additional time to migrate, but will no longer be able to stream from the Podcasts app directly after this date.The Google Podcasts app, installed over 500 million times on Android devices globally, for over half a decade has offered a simple and streamlined interface for discovering, following and listening to podcasts, as well as tools to add podcasts by RSS feed. Unfortunately for fans of the app, the tech giant said last September it would begin to wind down the Podcasts app in early 2024 as part of its broader plan to centralize its audio services under YouTube.In 2020, YouTube Music offered a similar transition strategy to move music listeners away from Google Play Music ahead of its shutdown that same year. However, the Google Podcasts app continued to be maintained for years because YouTube Music wasn't ready to support podcasts until more recently. By the end of 2023, YouTube Music was able to support podcasts globally, and, by February, they had the ability to upload their RSS feeds, too.The move to shift podcasting over to YouTube could help Google become a bigger player in the space, not only by combining its efforts and sharpening its focus, but also because interest in video podcasts -- which were already popular on YouTube -- is on the rise. This week, for example, Spotify forged a deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) to bring video podcasts to U.S. users of its streaming app after earlier in March announcing tests of video podcasts in 11 other markets around the world.Bleeping Computer was the first to notice the shutdown date for Google Podcasts in the U.S., and a support page on Google's site confirms that users in the U.S. will only be able to use the Podcasts app through the end of March 2024. For those who miss the in-app pop-ups, Google will offer users additional time to save their subscriptions by allowing them to use the app's export feature through July 2024.Story continuesGoogle did not immediately return a request for comment, but after publication did respond to say that while it was still \"tracking towards\" the April 2 timeline for the U.S., it has not shared a timeline for the rest of the world yet.From its earlier statements, though, the plan is to discontinue Google Podcasts globally in 2024.After spat with TikTok, UMG expands Spotify partnership to include music videos and moreUpdated, 3/29/24, 5:00 PM ET with Google comment.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/google-pushes-podcasts-users-in-u-s-to-move-to-youtube-music-by-april-2/"

        "Content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best growth ETFs to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\u00a0When interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invesco predicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.During economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanley suggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.Story continuesAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\u00a0\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201dSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cThe full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

Its portfolio consists of 227 stocks. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is one of the best growth ETFs to buy.\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cNetflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2014both categorized in the communication services sector\u2014rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.With regard to Meta, the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year\u2019s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold.

With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google\u2019s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)7.

        "Content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Jim Cramer Says You Should \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 These 11 Stocks.\u00a0For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article\u00a0Jim Cramer Says You Should \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 These 5\u00a0Stocks.Jim Cramer in his latest program talked about CNBC's Alpha Stock Survey according to which a \u201cmajority\u201d of investors believe the market is headed for a pullback. Cramer is not at all worried about a possible decline in the market.\"Hallelujah about that survey,\" Cramer said.Jim Cramer said that the S&P 500 is up 10% in the first three months of 2024, registering the best quarter since 2019. This makes Cramer believe that the market is indeed heading for a pullback. But he said we should \u201cwelcome it, not fear it.\u201dJim Cramer \"Welcomes\" Market Sell-OffsJim Cramer said that sell-offs are \u201cinevitable.\u201d He said even though we don\u2019t know when they will hit, they are always expected and we should take them as buying opportunities. Cramer said he learned the concept of welcoming sell-offs from the legendary investor Peter Lynch, who famously said that you should expect a 10% pullback on average after every two years and a 25% \u201cbeatdown\u201d every six years. Peter Lynch, Cramer reminded, said about 30 years ago that despite pullbacks and sell-offs the market tends to do well in the long term since according to his estimates corporate profits grow 8% per year. Lynch said the stock market follows corporate earnings and as a result made almost accurate predictions about the Dow Jones growing at about 8% per year.Cramer Thinks Market's \"Breadth Problem\" is SolvedJim Cramer also said that anyone who still \u201cinsists\u201d that this market is just about major tech names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other Mag. 7 stocks, they should rethink since he believes there are \u201cso many winners\u201d in the market that \u201cit\u2019s insane.\u201d Cramer believes the market no longer has the \u201cbreadth\u201d problem because returns are expanding across the board, sometimes at the \u201cexpense\u201d of mega-cap technology stocks.Story continuesJim Cramer thinks that it\u2019s of no use to stay fixated on the Federal Reserve for now, with all indications saying the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates. Cramer wants investors to instead focus on earnings and the performance of individual companies. Cramer said we haven\u2019t seen mass rounds of layoffs that many in the \u201chard landing\u201d camp were expecting. He said we are prepared to see another hot jobs report, but if it comes softer-than-expected, we will go into the next earnings season with a \u201cpleasant backdrop.\u201dJim Cramer Says You Should \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 These 11 StocksMethodologyFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few days and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors to buy.

Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.04, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 48.1% year over year to $276.27 million, beating estimates by $17.96 million.9. Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 34Jim Cramer thinks Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) is a \u201cgreat company to buy here.\u201d Cramer said that this mineral company is a \u201cterrific\" and \"really good\" idea.Over the past one year Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:RIO)\u00a0shares have gained about 4% over the past one year.Earlier this month, the stock was downgraded by Liberum to Hold from Buy amid softening demand and China-related concerns.8.

Coherent supplies engineered materials and devices to semiconductor equipment companies, data center and telecom companies, and it also produces lasers for industrial applications. The company has a long history of successfully innovating in these areas and is well-positioned to benefit from demand for advanced transceivers as artificial intelligence (AI) investments increase. As near-term cyclical headwinds have weighed on the share price, we capitalized on what we view as an attractive price relative to our estimate of intrinsic value to initiate a position.\u201d7. Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 37When asked about Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG), Cramer said that it\u2019s making money and since the stock has run a lot, investors should buy some of it now and then wait for a pullback before buying more.Pure Storage\u00a0Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\u00a0shares have gained 50% year to date through March 29.During its earnings call last month, the company talked about shareholder returns and guidance:\"We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY \u201925. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY \u201925, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.To help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY \u201925 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY \u201924. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY \u201925 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY \u201925 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY \u201924 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.\"Read the full earnings call transcript here.6.

        "Headline": "14 Best Stocks To Buy According to AI",
        "Content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the\u00a014 Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.\u00a0For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5\u00a0Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.When the generative AI boom started, investing circles brushed aside the possibility of AI picking stocks for humans to maximize returns. It\u2019s too complex and subjective a job for any AI model, they said. Fast forward a few months, more and more investment experts and firms are deploying AI for stock picking. Bloomberg in February reported that Vanguard Group was using AI in several of its products that use quant investing techniques. Among the funds where Vanguard has deployed machine learning models include the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund, the Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. The Bloomberg report said that the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund and the Strategic Small-Cap Fund beat their benchmarks and outperformed industry peers last year.Machine learning and algorithms have long been at play in the investing game for quant funds. But the generative AI boom is making the power of mathematical, AI-powered analysis available for everyone. Using AI in investing would no longer be limited to quant funds. Financial services company Mercer conducted a survey to find out the penetration of AI among investment managers across its Global Investment Manager Database. Nine out of 10 surveyed managers said they are already using or planning to use AI in their investment process. A whopping 54% of the investment managers said they are already using AI to assist their decision making, while 37% plan to use the technology in the near future.Mercer said in its report that the investment managers it surveyed said that the use of AI would give a whopping $14 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.Since generative AI and machine learning in investing is currently in its early stages, there are some challenges for investment managers who are trying to use the technology to their advantage. Data quality and data availability are among the biggest challenges these managers are facing.Story continuesHumans VS Robots in the Stock-Picking GameBut robots are not taking over the investing game (for now). Almost no one in the survey said they are completely outsourcing the investing-related decision-making to AI. They are using AI-powered models just for assistance, idea generation, data analysis and other important tasks in the investing process. Final decision-making still rests with humans. The report added:\u201cJust a small minority of managers report fully automated statistical, ML and DL models, reinforcing AI and ML technologies as tools that support managers, rather than replacing the role of manager judgment and intervention. Among managers currently using AI, around one in 10 report full automation of statistical models (11%), ML (14%) and DL models (6%), while a third report infrequent monitoring of these processes (33%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Across all three areas, a significant proportion of current AI processes remain reliant on constant human intervention, reinforcing the role of AI and ML technologies as a supportive \u201ctool\u201d rather than a direct replacement of humans across the investment process.\u201dBest Stocks To Buy According to AIMethodologyThis article is a performance evaluation of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year. We wanted to see whether ChatGPT is any good at stock picking. For that we reverted to our experiment with ChatGPT conducted in March 2023 where we asked ChatGPT to recommend some stocks that would make one rich over the next 10 years. We also consulted Finder.com\u2019s experiment with AI in which researchers at the comparison website asked ChatGPT to create a \u201cportfolio of stocks from high-quality businesses with criteria taken from the leading 10 funds it is competing against.\u201d This portfolio was also created back in March 2023.\u00a0 In this article we picked 14 stocks from these two ChatGPT-recommended portfolios with the highest number of hedge fund investors. With each stock we mentioned its performance since the date it was picked up by ChatGPT. The idea is to assess the performance of ChatGPT when it comes to stock picking.ChatGPT Stock Picks: Performance Overview After One Year14. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: Almost flatJohnson & Johnson\u00a0(NYSE:JNJ)\u00a0was also among the stocks recommended by ChatGPT to finder.com during the website\u2019s experiment last year. Since the AI model\u2019s recommendation till date the stock price has remained almost flat.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds had stakes in Johnson & Johnson\u00a0(NYSE:JNJ).ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\u201cThe health care space provided some opportunities in the quarter, as we increased our exposure to medical device company Becton, Dickinson as well as large cap pharmaceutical company\u00a0Johnson & Johnson\u00a0(NYSE:JNJ). Johnson & Johnson recently spun out its consumer health care business, becoming a more focused yet broadly diversified pharmaceutical and medtech company.\u201d13. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +6%Benzinga\u00a0asked ChatGPT to make a stock portfolio to beat the leading equity funds in the US backed in May 2023. Tesla\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0was one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT at the time. Since then through March 27, 2024, Tesla\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0shares have gained just 6% as Tesla\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0continues to battle growth issues amid a slowdown in EV demand.Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cTesla, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla\u2019s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company\u2019s full self-driving capabilities.\u201d12. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +11%Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have gained about 11% since March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended the stock to Insider Monkey\u2019s researchers when they asked the chatbot to suggest stocks that have the potential to make one rich. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been late to the AI game and perhaps that\u2019s why its stock gains aren\u2019t that impressive. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) business in China is also facing challenges. Analysts expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reveal its AI projects in the upcoming developer conference scheduled for June.Orbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cNever before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals\u2014Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\u201d11. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +14%Procter & Gamble\u00a0Co (NYSE:PG)\u00a0is one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year when Insider Monkey asked the AI technology to make a portfolio of stocks that would make one rich in the next decade. Since the recommendation date until today, the stock price has gained about 14%.Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cWe sold The Procter & Gamble Company\u00a0(NYSE:PG). After two years of strong pricing growth, the company is facing slower market growth in both the US and Europe. China, the company\u2019s second largest individual market, is facing a protracted downturn with poor visibility on when fundamentals will improve.\u201d10. Visa Inc (NYSE:V)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +28%On March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended Visa Inc (NYSE:V) to Insider Monkey, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) shares were trading at around $223, while the stock price sits at $279 today. This shows a 28% gain in stock price.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa\u00a0Inc (NYSE:V).In its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):\u201cVisa Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33. As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we\u2019re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa\u2019s outlook.\u201d9. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +29%When finder.com asked ChatGPT to make a market-beating stock portfolio back in March 2023, the LLM included Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) in the list of its stock recommendations. Since March 6, 2023, through date Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) shares have gained about 29%.8. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +42%Insider Monkey asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to make a stock portfolio that'd make one rich in the next ten years. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B) was part of the stocks recommended by the large language model. It proved to be one of the best stocks to buy according to AI because since March 16, 2023, the stock has gained about 42%.7. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +53%Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT to finder.com when the website asked the chatbot in March 2023 to make a portfolio. Since then through March 27, 2024, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares have gained about 53%. Adobe announced a host of new AI-related products at its annual Summit event recently.Here is what\u00a0Polen Global Growth\u00a0has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\u201cBoth Alphabet and Adobe\u2019s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to\u00a0Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.\u201d6. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +65%Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is one of the best stocks to buy according to AI.

Since then through March 27, 2024, Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0shares have gained about 65% in value.Wedbush Securities recently added Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0to its Best Ideas list and said the \u201cperceived\u201d risks to Google Search are overblown and Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0remains a \u201cnet beneficiary\u201d of generative AI.Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cIn early 2023, we initiated an investment in\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company\u2019s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.Since we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google\u2019s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\u00a0Click to continue reading and see\u00a05\u00a0Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.

        "Headline": "Are the \"Magnificent Seven\" Too Expensive to Buy?",
        "Content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" has driven most of the stock market gains since the beginning of 2023, but each stock is starting to show cracks in its armor. Some of them have gotten far too extended and trade for unreasonable valuations despite the success in their underlying businesses. But are all of them overvalued?Let's examine this group and see if any could be considered cheap or if you'll need to pay a hefty premium to own these seven stocks.The Magnificent Seven aren't all dominating as they did in 2023The Magnificent Seven is made up of the following companies:Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)2023 was a phenomenal year for this cohort, with the worst-performing stock (Apple) returning nearly 50%. However, 2024 hasn't been so kind, and each stock's performance has been all over the place.MSFT data by YCharts.Part of this dichotomy has been valuation, as investors aren't willing to pay up to own some of the stocks in the Magnificent Seven.Because the Magnificent Seven are mostly considered growth companies, I'll use their revenue growth combined with their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to assess their valuation; I believe these two metrics show a wider picture. Cost reduction measures can prop up earnings, but those can only grow earnings for so long without any top-line growth.Tesla has had the worst year, losing nearly a third of its value this year. Its declining market value can be attributed to slowing growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales and shrinking margins due to rising competition. The really high premium that investors were willing to pay for the stock tumbled, and now the stock trades for 55 times forward earnings.Apple is in a similar situation, but its problems have occurred for much longer. Throughout 2023, Apple's quarterly revenue either shrank or grew at a 2% pace on a year-on-year basis. That's not great for a company valued like a growth stock, so it is no surprise that investors aren't willing to pay as much of a premium. Even at its current 26 times forward earnings, the stock still looks pricey for its growth.Story continuesBesides these two, the rest are up in 2024, but that doesn't mean they are all overpriced.The remaining five have varying situationsAlphabet and Meta Platforms come to the top of the list for stocks that I believe aren't overpriced. Alphabet, Google's parent company, has had some public relations issues related to the rollout of its generative AI model. However, Alphabet's ad business is still doing well, and with the company trading at 22 times forward earnings, it's the cheapest on the list.Meta isn't much more expensive, with the stock trading at 25.5 times forward earnings. Since its primary business is advertising (through its various social media platforms), it's benefiting from the same ad recovery wave as Alphabet. As a result, it's primed to continue growing for some time.Nvidia isn't as expensive as some may expect, as its vast growth hasn't concluded yet. At 38 times forward earnings, it's quite pricey, but with Nvidia being at the center of the AI revolution with its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), it's to be expected.Amazon is more difficult to assess. It's still optimizing its business for profits, so its forward earnings multiple is skewed and will likely remain that way for some time. At 42 times earnings, it's the second-most expensive on the list. However, with Amazon's rising gross profit margin, it will only be a matter of time before its profits rocket higher and its valuation looks more reasonable.AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.Lastly, Microsoft is one of the most expensive stocks on this list despite being the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Microsoft's valuation is an incredibly pricey 37 times forward earnings -- nearly as expensive as Nvidia's despite far less growth. It earned this premium through fantastic AI product rollout and increased cloud computing market share. However, 37 times earnings is a lot for a company growing at 18% that appears to be fully optimized for profits.So, with all that information, how do these stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive?Valuation rankingsRanking the stocks by their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple alone doesn't tell the full picture, as companies like Apple are struggling to grow while Nvidia is tripling its revenue. These rankings won't solely be based on metrics; they'll also include a nod to current growth and future opportunities.With that in mind, here are my rankings of the Magnificent Seven from the cheapest to most expensive:AlphabetMeta PlatformsAmazonNvidiaTeslaMicrosoftAppleRanking Alphabet and Meta as the cheapest was a no-brainer, but I'm also convinced that Amazon and Nvidia have more room to grow, making their expensive valuations seem cheaper in the grand scheme of things. Tesla is hard to figure out, but if EV demand continues to rise, this may be a bargain price. Lastly, Microsoft and Apple are very expensive for their growth, with Apple being the worst offender because it's hardly growing.Although this is my ranking, investors should decide for themselves whether any of these stocks are \"cheap\" enough to buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Ranked From Best to Worst Performance Over Time",
        "Content": "The S&P 500 roared higher over the past year or so from its bear market low to a new all-time high -- and this movement confirmed the market has indeed shifted into bull territory. The gains weren't exactly broad-based though. Stocks dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- drove gains as they soared in the double or triple digits last year.Of course, that's just a short-term increase. But these stocks have proven themselves over a longer period too. Let's take a look at the performance of each of these players over the past five years and see if they still represent compelling buy stories. Here they are, ranked from best to worst, according to performance.Image source: Getty Images.1. Nvidia, up 1,950%Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and share price growth truly took off thanks to its crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used to be best known for their role in gaming -- but the ability to rapidly process many tasks simultaneously made Nvidia's GPUs a perfect fit for AI.Today, Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI chip market, and that's not likely to change as the company invests heavily to stay ahead of rivals. This tech giant just recently announced its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips ever, set for release later this year.2. Tesla, up 881%Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings and share price performance actually have slowed in recent times as various factors weigh on the electric vehicle giant -- from higher costs linked to production ramp-ups to negative foreign exchange impact.But Tesla surged over the past five years as the company delivered more and more vehicles, opened major new factories, delivered record earnings, and built up more than $29 billion in cash. The cash level is particularly important because it will help this ambitious EV leader continue to innovate and potentially progress on programs such as self-driving technology.Story continuesSo, Tesla's slowdown looks like a temporary situation, meaning growth probably isn't over for this market giant.3. Apple, up 268%Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) brand strength has helped it keep users coming back to world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac -- and even continue to attract new customers. This has made Apple the go-to stock for the technology investor seeking growth and safety. The company even won over billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has almost half of his portfolio invested in the tech giant.Some may worry that Apple's growth could plateau at a certain point, but one particular thing makes me confident that won't happen. The company's services -- sold to its growing user base -- have taken off, with services revenue reaching records. And this could drive a whole new era of growth for Apple.4. Microsoft, up 260%Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), like Apple, is a classic tech company that's proven its strength over the long haul. But in recent times, Microsoft also has shown its ability to seize a growth opportunity. The company was an early believer in AI, investing $1 billion in OpenAI, the developer of chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019.The tech powerhouse later extended the partnership and increased its investment, a move that also strengthened the company's cloud business, Azure. This business offers a wide variety of AI tools and has seen its revenue growth soar, rising 30% in the most recent period -- surpassing that of rivals Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Their revenue advanced 13% and 26%, respectively.So, Microsoft clearly could be a winner in the potential AI revolution.5. Meta Platforms, up 197%Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) went through a period of cost cutting in recent times, but at the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned for the next step for this social media giant. And that's building up strengths in AI. The company has gone all in on that, developing its own large language model and aiming to apply AI across its products and services.On top of that, Meta's dominance in social media is unwavering, a key point since it, through advertising, brings in most of the company's revenue. It's easy to imagine AI further boosting the company's social media platforms and driving more growth.6. Alphabet, up 159%Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has an extremely solid moat, or competitive advantage, in the business that brings in the lion's share of its revenue. And that's Google Search, which holds more than 90% of the global search market. This has kept advertisers coming back, even during recent times of higher inflation.Today, Alphabet, like many of these Magnificent Seven companies, is investing in AI, and this technology is helping it to make search faster and better. This, along with AI offerings through Google Cloud, may power earnings growth in the coming years.7. Amazon, up 103%Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed during the early days of the pandemic as customers flocked to e-commerce -- but a couple of years later, higher inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and the wallets of its customers. And that hurt stock performance, making Amazon the worst-performing of the Magnificent Seven over the past five years (though a 100% gain isn't something to frown about).But the company revamped its cost structure\u00a0and shifted from an annual loss in 2022 to solid profit in 2023, and the shares went on to gain. And this may continue thanks to Amazon's focus on AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its own operations and selling AI products and services through AWS, the world's cloud services leader.Are the Magnificent Seven stocks buys today?Now, let's get back to our question: Do these high-flying stocks still represent compelling buys? As you can see in the chart, they remain reasonably priced in relation to forward earnings estimates if you consider the long-term growth prospects of each of these players.AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) ChartTesla is the most expensive by this measure, but these figures consider potential earnings next year -- which is rather short term. The EV giant's moves today to lower the costs of producing its vehicles and incorporate AI in its processes could pay off over the coming years, making today's valuation look fair. Still, other players like Alphabet or Meta clearly are cheap and may represent an even better buying opportunity right now.And here's one important thing to note: Some of these companies went through rough patches in recent times, yet they still managed to deliver big gains over a five-year period. This is a great example of the power of long-term investing, which implies holding on to a stock for at least five years.All of this means it's not too late to get in on some or all of the Magnificent Seven, a group of quality stocks that could continue to deliver top returns over the long haul.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.
