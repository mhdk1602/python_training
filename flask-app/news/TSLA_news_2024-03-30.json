        "Content": "FAZRY ISMAIL / EPA-EFE / Shutterstock.comElectric vehicle manufacturer Tesla recently beat out Toyota as the bestselling new vehicle in the state of California, based on recent data from the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). In spite of this, Tesla\u2019s growth is down from its record 50% annual growth, and, at the company\u2019s third-quarter investor call, shareholders did not seem happy.Read More: 7 Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From BuyingCheck Out: 8 Best Compact Cars for Your Money in 2024Tesla has managed to almost saturate the electric vehicle market. The U.S.-based manufacturer dominated the list of bestselling EVs in 2022, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3, separately, outselling the other six brands of EVs on the list, combined.In addition to the four bestselling Tesla models (S,3,X, and Y), the list includes the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Hyundai Ioniq5, Volkswagen ID.4, Kia EV6 and Rivian R1T models.Fortune reported that Tesla\u2019s massive sales numbers have left shareholders wondering what will happen to the company\u2019s growth when everyone who wants a Tesla \u2014 and can afford a Tesla \u2014 has already purchased one.\u201cWe\u2019re just hitting a \u2018law of large numbers\u2019 situation here,\u201d Musk told shareholders during the meeting.Advertising, or \u201ccustomer education\u201d as advocates call it since the Tesla CEO has often argued against paid ads, may not help. \u201cInforming people of a car that is great but they cannot afford doesn\u2019t really help,\u201d Musk previously said, according to Fortune.He also explained during the meeting, \u201cFor the vast majority of people, buying a car is about the monthly payment.\u201dBut monthly payments are increasing for new car buyers as interest rates continue to rise, which makes the affordability of luxury vehicles like the Tesla Model S and X even more of a challenge. Tesla introduced the Model 3 and Model Y to provide vehicles at a lower price point. They are competitively priced to other top selling EVs (namely, the Ford Mustang EV) and even hybrid electrics. And, as pointed out earlier, they top the list of the bestselling EVs for 2022, just ahead of the Ford Mustang Mach-E.Story continuesNo doubt, there are less expensive EVs on the market, although not many and not by much. But are they a better value?Read on as we compare the Tesla models 3 and Y to the popular Mustang Mach-E, the Chevy Bolt, and to a handful of Toyotas.Trending Now: 10 Affordable Compact Cars That Will Last 300,000 MilesSince Toyota has been emphasizing its plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) over the bZ4X all-electric model, we included the 2023 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid and the 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid in our evaluation.The Highlander, with its spacious cabin and third-row seating plus excellent gas mileage, could be considered a close competitor to the Tesla Model Y \u2014 at least, as close as anything else on the market today. We left the Model X and S out of the comparison since, as luxury vehicles, these fall into a different class.As a frustrated Musk told shareholders during the Q3 meeting, \u201cIf our car cost the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4.\u201d But how much does the humble RAV4 Hybrid cost compared to a Model 3?We compared the base model for each car in our evaluation and tried to correct for gas savings and federal incentives, when applicable. Tesla Model 3Tesla vehicles beat competitors in range, with the entry-level Model 3 boasting a 272-mile range. According to the Tesla website, leases for a Model 3 start at $329 per month for qualified buyers with excellent credit.If you have no incentives and don\u2019t factor in gas savings, the Model 3 has a sticker price of $38,990. Granted, this is a smaller vehicle not designed for large families or road trips. When you consider the fun and prestige of driving this vehicle \u2014 which provides amazing handling and a tech package second-to-none at this price \u2014 it\u2019s easily worth the cost.Tesla Model YThe third-row Tesla Model Y is an affordable family SUV. Not counting incentives and gas savings, the SUV has a sticker price of $36,490, which is less than the Mustang Mach-E, the Toyota Highlander Hybrid or even a RAV4 Hybrid. You can lease one for roughly $369 per month with excellent credit. The car has a range of 330 miles per charge, which is better than the other EVs we compared.Ford Mustang Mach-EAn American legend, the conventional, gas-engine Ford Mustang falls somewhere between a luxury vehicle designed to turn heads and a well-loved sports car for the masses. With the Mustang Mach-E, Ford changed the styling of this beloved vehicle, but maintained the power and added an eco-friendly factor appealing to many.The base model has an MSRP of $42,995 and a range of 250 miles per charge, along with Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving. You can lease it at a minimum of $572, which makes it pricier than a Model 3 or Model Y if you qualify for various incentives and have excellent credit for the lowest interest lease. The sticker price is also higher than either of the lower cost Teslas.Know: 5 Electric Vehicles That Will Likely Break Down After 50,000 MilesChevy Bolt EV/EUVRated as the fourth bestselling electric vehicle in 2022 (behind the Tesla Model Y, Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E), the Chevrolet Bolt EV and its sports utility sibling, the EUV, start at $27,495 and $28,795, respectively. If you\u2019re in the market for an affordable EV, the Bolt may be your best option.The Bolt EUV has the stylings of a Chevy Equinox or Toyota RAV4, with more cargo space than the Bolt EV. The range for the EUV is 247 miles, while the Bolt EV goes roughly 259 miles on a single charge. This compares favorably to the Tesla Model 3 or Model Y.Toyota bZ4X Coming in roughly the same price as the Mustang Mach-E \u2014 at $42,000 \u2014 Toyota\u2019s new bZ4X could be worth taking a chance on. Consider that the car experienced a massive recall and stop-sale in 2022, but the problem has since been fixed. The car has slightly less range than competitors, with various models going from 222 to 252 miles on a single charge.Toyota offers 1.99% per month financing for 48 months or a 36-month lease at $576 per month with $3,226 due at signing. For most buyers on a budget, it seems a Model Y or Model 3 would be more within reach than Toyota\u2019s fresh-off-the-assembly-line EV.It\u2019s worth noting that, according to the Toyota website, this vehicle isn\u2019t expected to be available until late 2023, early 2024 in many markets. Car and Driver found a few hundred for all through a nationwide dealer inventory search.Toyota Highlander Plug-in HybridFollowing the recall and stop-sale of the bZ4X, Toyota continues to emphasize its plug-in hybrid line of vehicles. With a starting price of $40,620, the Highlander Hybrid comes in less than the Mustang Mach-E but more than the Model Y or Model 3.Both the Model Y and the Highlander have third-row seating, making them great for road trips or larger families. While you can\u2019t compare range on a hybrid, the Highlander Hybrid has an estimated 36 mpg combined mileage. Toyota is offering a 4.99% APR for 48 months for highly qualified buyers or a lease at $589 per month, with $3,999 due at signing.When it comes to EVs or hybrid vehicles for the family, Tesla is not the priciest game in town.Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Plug-inLet\u2019s address Musk\u2019s comment that if a Tesla cost the same as a RAV4, everyone would buy a Tesla. Perhaps he was addressing the prices of the higher-end S and X models, which are really in a different class of vehicle. With the Y and 3, Tesla sought to create an EV for the masses and, largely, succeeded. But, it turns out, a hybrid RAV4 is roughly the same price as a Tesla Model 3 or Model Y.The sticker price for a base model RAV4 plug-in hybrid is $37,454. That\u2019s slightly more than a Tesla Model 3 or a Model Y, but you can\u2019t factor in the gas savings as easily with a hybrid electric vehicle. The overall cost of ownership may come in less for a Tesla.The lease price for the RAV4 Hybrid is also higher than the lower end Tesla models, with $3,171 due at signing for a 36-month lease and payments of $521 per month (for qualified buyers with excellent credit).Sponsored: Credit card debt keeping you up at night? Find out if you can reduce your debt with these 3 stepsBottom LineIt\u2019s clear from our research that if electric vehicle adoption is to accelerate to meet the country\u2019s carbon footprint goals, affordable EVs must be made available. But it would seem the onus isn\u2019t all on Tesla to lower prices.Aside from the Model S and Model X, which are luxury vehicles and priced accordingly, the Y and 3 are priced competitively for their market. Consumers have a variety of options to choose from in EVs, PHEVs or even traditional gas vehicles.More From GOBankingRatesThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Tesla, Toyota, Ford or Chevy: Which EVs and Hybrids Are the Best Buy for the Money?"

        "Content": "Tesla's first-quarter delivery figures that are expected to be released next week are forecast to be relatively soft amid intensifying competition and lagging demand \u2014 a dynamic that has investors on edge ahead of the release.The EV maker, led by Elon Musk, is bracing for a slowdown in 2024 after years of rapid sales growth, with analysts lowering their expectations for the company's first-quarter deliveries to account for a slowdown. Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023 \u2014 a level that it may struggle to reach this quarter.Wedbush Securities noted that delivery estimates have fallen from about 475,000 to 425,000 vehicles as a \"perfect storm of demand issues hit\" and hurt the company's sales figures. Those headwinds have caused Tesla's stock to struggle as a result, declining by 29.2% year to date through Friday.\"The biggest and most concerning issue for Tesla (and its investors) remains China as rising EV competition and a lingering price war has made this key market very challenging for Tesla the last year and especially the last quarter,\" wrote Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst Wedbush Securities, in a note to investors.SENATOR WARREN URGES SEC TO INVESTIGATE TESLA OVER BOARD INDEPENDENCEModels of new EVs are displayed at a Tesla store in Shanghai on Tuesday.Ives said the arrival of Tesla's delivery numbers \"will not be a moment of celebration for the bulls and instead be a rip the band-aid quarter\" for the company's investors.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPHe wrote that while Tesla is in a lull between periods of growth, investors are getting impatient, which is \"being exacerbated\" by Musk's discussion about developing artificial intelligence (AI) tools outside of Tesla, issues with the board, a Delaware court voiding Musk's compensation package and \"now a likely move to incorporate in Texas.\"Ives explained that while there has been negativity about Tesla in the past, this time it is warranted due to sluggish growth and compressed margins amid the competition with low-cost Chinese EV makers like BYD.Story continuesXiaomi, another Chinese EV rival, rolled out a new electric Sedan on Thursday that is expected to undercut the price of Tesla's Model 3 by about $4,000, according to a report by Barron's.TESLA DELIVERIES EXPECTED TO SLUMP ON CHINA COMPETITION, WEAK DEMANDTesla CEO Elon Musk said he'll call for a vote on moving Tesla's incorporation state from Delaware to Texas after a court invalidated his $56 billion pay package.Musk has aggressively discounted Tesla's EVs since late 2022 in an effort to boost sales amid the high interest rate environment, which has increased the cost of car payments for customers. While those cuts have helped support demand, they come at the expense of the company's profit margins.Musk said the price cuts are needed to maintain demand for Tesla's vehicles and to keep production facilities operating as efficiently as possible. Some of those discounts have been temporary tweaks to pricing, such as Tesla's $1,000 price cuts for its Model Y rear-wheel drive and long-range variants in February that elapsed at the beginning of March.\"This is the essential quandary of manufacturing: factories need continuous production for efficiency, but consumer demand is seasonal,\" Musk wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, responding to a post by Tesla indicating the March price change.TESLA CEO ELON MUSK VISITS GIGA BERLIN AS PRODUCTION RESUMES FOLLOWING ARSON ATTACKThe Tesla Gigafactory near Berlin has experienced production stoppages this year due to supply chain challenges and an arson attack.Tesla's production facilities have experienced some interruptions this quarter, as well.Houthi militants' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden caused shipping to be rerouted away from the area and the Suez Canal to around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa.That created longer shipping times that caused Tesla to suspend most of its car production at its Gigafactory near Berlin from Jan. 29 to Feb. 11 due to a shortage of parts.Tesla's Gruenheide factory was also idled for nearly a week in early March due to an arson attack by an environmental activist on an electricity transmission facility that powered the plant.Original article source: Tesla's tough quarter has investors anxious"

        "Content": "Amid rising competition and a lackluster stock performance, Tesla is brushing off CEO Elon Musk\u2019s previous disdain for marketing and pushing ahead with digital ads in search of a much needed sales boost.The company spent an estimated $6.4 million on digital advertising last year, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing data from Vivvix, a subsidiary of ad-tracking platform MediaRadar. The company\u2019s marketing budget last year dwarfed the $175,000 Vivvix estimates that the company spent in 2022. Tesla has spent 900 times more on U.S.-targeted digital advertising in the first quarter compared to a year ago, according to a report by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.Tesla\u2019s ad spend was mostly focused on YouTube, Sensor Tower reported, but also included campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Google, and the Musk-owned X platform, according to a review of publicly available data.More affordable than you thinkWorld\u2019s bestselling SUV is $1k off this monthPrices will go up again in Marchhttps://t.co/tEj0udh3Ll pic.twitter.com/aFPqU1CnyG\u2014 Tesla (@Tesla) February 11, 2024Many of the ads are promoting the company\u2019s Model Y vehicle, with a call to buy before prices increase on April 1. Some tout Tesla features such as its Autopilot and extra cargo space, while others show families using the touchscreen to play games or stream video.Musk and Tesla have often dismissed traditional forms of promotion, relying instead on word-of-mouth, referral programs, and the starpower of its chief executive to attract customers. The Tesla CEO has previously said money spent on publicity campaigns would be better spent elsewhere.\u201cTesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great,\u201d he wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, in 2019.Story continuesStill, Tesla shares\u2019 nearly 30% nosedive since January and heightened competition from Chinese EV makers has recently led Musk to open up more to advertising. In response to a question at last year\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May, Musk said Tesla would \u201c[T]ry a little advertising and see how it goes.\u201dThe company\u2019s reversal on advertising comes as the first three months of the year wrap up and analysts prepare for what could be a subpar quarter for the EV maker. Several analysts have already downgraded their estimates for first quarter vehicle deliveries (an approximation for sales) after Bloomberg reported last week that Tesla was cutting back production at its plant in China.On Wednesday, Wedbush Securities cut its estimate to 425,968 from about 475,000, according to a note. The consistently bullish Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also cut his price target to $300 from $315, although the firm reiterated its \u201coutperform\u201d rating for the company.A recent internal email to staff showed Musk is not just relying on digital advertising but also aggressive promotion to beef up sales of its $12,000 per year subscription for \u201cfull-self driving.\u201d In a leaked internal email this week, Musk said Tesla staff were required to give potential customers a quick trial while they are picking up their cars.\u201cI know this will slow down the delivery process, but it is nonetheless a hard requirement,\u201d he wrote in the internal email.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "Content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best growth ETFs to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\u00a0When interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invesco predicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.During economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanley suggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.Story continuesAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\u00a0\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201dSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Apple's push for a streaming service in China faces challenges due to censorship regulations, necessitating a domestic partnership. Despite hurdles, Apple aims to strengthen its presence in China, which is a crucial market. Chinese companies like ByteDance have already introduced apps for Vision Pro outside China, indicating potential for further collaborations.According to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise \u2013 perhaps even shock \u2013 to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China\u2019s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)11.

UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could reach $150 billion in revenue by 2025, a 30% increase year-over-year.

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals\u2014Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.Or how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year\u2019s projected revenue.

Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value.
