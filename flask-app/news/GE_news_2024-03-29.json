        "Headline": "General Electric Has Almost Doubled Since Last Year. Is the Stock Back?",
        "Content": "General Electric (NYSE: GE) remains a household name after generations as a mega-conglomerate that dabbled in many industries, from home appliances to healthcare. Even so, the financial crisis from 2008 to 2009 was nearly fatal for the company, and it's spent over a decade evolving and trying to get back on its feet.Today General Electric looks far different from the company your parents or grandparents might recognize. In this case, change is good. General Electric seems to be a much stronger and more focused business than before.On top of that, shares have nearly doubled over the past year. Is the stock back? Here is what you need to know.From conglomerate to niche companyGeneral Electric nearly went bankrupt when its financial arm was caught up in the financial crisis. Since then, the stock hasn't been the same. It went through a dark period where shares whipsawed, hitting their lows during the pandemic. To this day, shares have not recovered the highs they reached before 2008-2009:GE ChartThe company has undergone significant changes over the years. In the mid-2010s, it sold off most of its financial operations and announced a plan in late 2021 to break into three distinct companies.The healthcare business was spun off as GE Healthcare Technologies last year. Its energy business will become GE Vernova on April 2, 2024. That leaves General Electric's aviation business, which will maintain General Electric's ticker and operate as GE Aerospace.To be clear, investors considering buying the stock are buying a business focused on commercial and military aviation.Looking at this \"new\" General ElectricWith so many moving parts, it is best to take a long-term look at the company. Fortunately, management laid out some solid long-term expectations for the company:Image Source: General ElectricThe company believes it can generate high-single-digit revenue growth over time. That will come from more robust growth in the commercial engines and services business, where management is forecasting high-teens revenue growth this year. The defense and propulsion business is expected to grow in the low-to-mid-single-digit range.Story continuesThe company will also receive a nice cash injection between 2024 and 2026. Management expects around $25 billion in total deployable cash from operations and proceeds from the spin-offs. Management will pay investors 30% of net income as dividends and deploy a $15 billion share repurchase program.General Electric is back. Should investors buy the stock?A growing, focused company that's repurchasing shares sounds pretty appealing. Indeed, it seems GE Aviation is worth owning in a long-term portfolio. The big question now is whether the stock's worth buying today. After all, shares have nearly doubled in value over the past year.But those gains have been justified by much stronger financials. The company never did $4.8 billion in free cash flow in the past three years, but management is guiding for over $5 billion this year (just GE Aviation), which should continue to grow as operating profit does. Management is targeting $10 billion in operating profit in 2028, up from $6 billion expected this year.GE Free Cash Flow (Annual) ChartGE Aviation's free cash flow yield is 2.6% today, not factoring in the looming spin-off of GE Vernova. That's not cheap relative to what it's yielded in recent years. Investors bullish on the company's long-term prospects should consider dollar-cost averaging into the stock while all these moving parts settle so the company can put together a few quarters of post-spin-off earnings to show it's on track with guidance.Should you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?Before you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and General Electric wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Headline": "Boeing's shakeup and GE's fall: 2 more black eyes for Jack Welch's legacy",
        "Content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:You have to love the irony of it.This week, Dave Calhoun, an acolyte of the late Jack Welch, the legendary longtime chief executive of General Electric, said he was quitting as chief executive of Boeing, joining the list of unsuccessful Welch disciple CEOs.And Welch\u2019s legacy will disappear when General Electric\u2019s name vanishes from the list of publicly traded US stocks on Tuesday. That\u2019s when GE, which spun off GE HealthCare last year, will split itself into GE Vernova and GE Aerospace.The combination of Calhoun quitting, the end of the conglomerate, and General Electric\u2019s name disappearing tells us a lot about how the world has changed since Welch was worshiped by the likes of Fortune Magazine (which named him the Manager of the Century in 1999) and the Financial Times (which named GE \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Respected Company\u201d for the third straight year in 2000, the year before Welch stepped down as CEO).I wrote about the end of Welch\u2019s legacy last year after Larry Culp, who became GE\u2019s CEO in 2018, announced plans to split the company into three pieces, none of which would be named General Electric. As the Welch hagiography died down, the mess left behind showed that his genius was as much in playing accounting games as anything else.Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, in his New York City apartment. (Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images) (Brooks Kraft via Getty Images)Culp, the first GE chief executive who hadn\u2019t been a company employee, succeeded two Welch acolytes in the position: John Flannery, who lasted 14 disastrous months, and Jeff Immelt, Welch\u2019s chosen successor, who had lasted for 16 less-than-mediocre years before that.After I finished laughing at the irony of Dave Calhoun stepping down the week before the name General Electric vanishes from the markets, I decided this would be a good time to compile a list of unsuccessful CEOs who were Jack Welch mentees.Story continuesI had no idea that the list would be so long.I combined my knowledge from decades of writing about business with additional research, then read a 2022 book about Welch written by David Gelles, a New York Times journalist. The title says it all: \"The Man Who Broke Capitalism: How Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate America \u2014 and How to Undo His Legacy.\"Between my work and Gelles\u2019s book, I ended up with a list of 13 unsuccessful CEOs who had been Welch followers. To show that the world isn\u2019t totally black and white, I also included four successful Welch acolyte CEOs.What surprised me about the list is that no fewer than four of the 13 had been CEOs of the same company: Boeing. I have no idea why that is. I was also surprised to see that three of the 13 got two shots at being CEOs and all three went 0 for 2.In fairness, you can see why so many boards of so many companies were eager to hire Welchies as CEOs. Jack Welch was a megasuccessful CEO \u2014 or, at least, he seemed to be. GE\u2019s stock rose 5,600% during his 20-year tenure, which was eight times the S&P 500\u2019s 700% rise. (I\u2019m not including dividends in either of those numbers).Welch was also enormously respected by wide swaths of the business community and society at large, and for a while, GE was the US\u2019s most valuable company, with its stock worth $600 billion.After Welch retired from GE, it became clear that the company had been playing earnings and accounting games that were made possible by the dozens of acquisitions that Welch made and by the fact that he\u2019d built GE\u2019s finance subsidiary into a gigantic operation. Financial assets allow far more flexibility than manufacturing does when it comes to reporting gains and losses.There\u2019s lots that we can learn from the Terrible 13 Welch followers who were unsuccessful CEOs. The biggest thing is that what seemed to work for Welch \u2014 \u201cranking and yanking\u201d by firing the bottom 10% of employees every year, playing endless accounting games to make quarterly earnings goals, not thinking long-term \u2014 is no way to run a company.Disclosures: I have a medium-size GE holding that I\u2019ve bought in several stages since Larry Culp became its CEO. I began buying GE because I\u2019ve got sizable gains on my investment in Danaher Corp., which prospered under Culp\u2019s leadership. I have a modest investment in GE HealthCare, and I\u2019ve given each of my grandchildren 16 shares of GE.Correction: A previous version of this article included an incorrect spelling of Jack Welch's name. We regret the error.Allan Sloan\u00a0is an award-winning financial journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.morning brief image"

        "Headline": "20 Windiest Cities in the United States",
        "Content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 windiest cities in the United States. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US wind energy market, you can go to the 5 Windiest Cities in the United States.With a total installed capacity of 132,938 MW, the United States holds the title of being the world\u2019s second-biggest producer of wind energy. In the year 2022, wind power emerged as a significant contributor to the US electricity grid. Across 42 states, utility-scale wind farms harnessed the power of the wind to generate a remarkable 10% of the nation's total electricity production.This translates to a staggering 435 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) being generated from these sources, highlighting the growing role of wind energy in the US. Some of the states contribute more to wind power generation in the country than others. The five major states that produced the most wind energy in 2022 were Kansas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Texas, and Iowa. Together, they churned out a whopping 57% of the total wind electricity generation in the US. These are among the windiest states of the USA. They are located in the Central and Midwest Region, which is among the windiest places in North America. The high wind speed in these states has made them suitable for wind power generation.However, there is still a lot more potential for wind power generation in the US. The annual wind power potential of the continental US stands at 43,000 terawatt-hours (TWh). This is much more than the electricity consumption of the entire United States, which was a mere 4,048 TWh in 2022. Due to the potential, the US wind energy market is on a promising trajectory, with forecasts predicting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.87% between 2022 and 2027. Other factors fueling this growth include favorable government policies, reduced cost of wind energy, increased investment in the sector, and concerns for climatic change.Key Players Driving Innovation in the US Wind Energy MarketWith several players competing for a share of the market, the market is characterized by moderate fragmentation. Some of the major players in the US wind energy market include Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and \u00d8rsted A/S (CPH:ORSTED). All of them have made significant contributions to this sector and continue to do so as part of their strategic plans.Story continuesDuke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is taking a big step towards a cleaner future with its ambitious clean energy plan. This plan outlines significant carbon emission reductions, aiming for at least a 50% decrease by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050. To achieve this, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is leading the industry in coal plant retirements. They aim to reduce coal dependence to less than 5% of their total energy generation by 2030, with a complete phase-out by 2035, pending regulatory approval. This aggressive plan demonstrates Duke Energy's commitment to a sustainable future. The company recently also started operations on a 207 MW wind farm located in Iowa.General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is not far behind. As a leading force in wind energy, the company has deployed over 49,000 wind turbines globally. Their versatile designs, suited for various wind conditions, harness both onshore and offshore wind potential. This translates to a massive renewable energy capacity of 400 GW worldwide. General Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) commitment continues with its spin-off, GE Vernova. Invested in boosting American wind energy, GE Vernova pledged over $50 million for a new wind turbine facility in the state of New York. This initiative, completed in November 2023, resulted in the production of the 6.1-158 onshore wind turbine.Similarly, \u00d8rsted A/S (CPH:ORSTED), a major force in offshore wind, partnered with Eversource to launch the nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in March 2024. Around 35 miles east of Montauk Point, New York, the company's 12-turbine South Fork wind farm marks a significant milestone in expanding US renewable energy production.20 Windiest Cities in the United StatesWind turbines against a backdrop of the sky, signifying the power of renewable energy.Our MethodologyTo compile the list of the 20 windiest cities in the United States, we relied on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency specializing in weather study and forecasting. The metric utilized was the average annual wind speed measured in miles per hour (mph). NOAA's data tracked the average wind speed on a monthly basis over a span of 38 years to calculate both monthly and annual averages for each location. In our compilation, we included only cities with populations of 50,000 people and above, as per the latest census. The windiest cities in the United States are ranked in ascending order based on their average annual wind speed.You can also check out the 20 Cloudiest Cities in the U.S., Ranked here.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\u00a020 Windiest Cities in the United States20. San Francisco, CaliforniaAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 10.5 mphSan Francisco is situated on a peninsula and is surrounded by water from three sides. The city experiences noticeable winds throughout the year, blowing in from the Pacific Ocean. Cold water currents near the city create cooler air over the water, leading to differences in pressure that generate wind.19. Rapid City, South DakotaAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 10.6 mphBeing located at the edge of the Black Hills, Rapid City is exposed to winds without major geographical barriers. Rapid City also has a fairly consistent wind speed throughout the year, with a slight dip in summer. The average annual wind speed is 10.6 miles per hour, with slightly higher speeds in winter and slightly lower in summer.18. Billings, MontanaAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 10.7 mphBillings, Montana experiences moderate windiness year-round. Wind speeds are higher in winter and a bit lower in summer. In fact, January is the city\u2019s windiest month, with wind speeds going as high as 13.4 miles per hour on average.17. Midland-Odessa, TexasAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 10.9 mphSitting on the southern extension of the South Plains and lacking any major geographical obstacles to wind flow, Midland-Odessa, Texas, experiences windier conditions than usual. Also, due to low vegetation cover in Midland-Odessa, there is little resistance to winds. During late winter and early spring, visibility can be reduced, especially when dust is blowing.16. Abilene, TexasAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 10.9 mphThis city sits on the edge of the Texas High Plains. Thanks to its flat terrain, unpredictable air currents, and frequent summer storms, Abilene joins the ranks of the windiest cities in the United States. Some days in Abilene can be quite blustery, with winds reaching speeds of over 20 mph.15. Fargo, North DakotaAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 11.1 mphFargo, North Dakota, is no stranger to strong winds. Several factors contribute to its windy reputation.\u00a0 Firstly, its location on the Great Plains means there are few obstacles to disrupt wind patterns.\u00a0 Secondly, a geographical feature called the Pembina Escarpment, a slight elevation change east of the city can strengthen winds as they move across it.\u00a0 Finally, Fargo experiences frequent passage of high- and low-pressure systems throughout the year, which cause air movement and contribute to its overall windy character.14. Grand Island, NebraskaAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 11.1 mphGrand Island, Nebraska, frequently experiences strong winds due to a combination of geographical and climatic factors. Lack of obstacles to the prevailing winds and frequent high- and low-pressure systems lead to the city experiencing winds year-round.13. Galveston, TexasAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 11.2 mphWith an average wind speed of around 11.2 miles per hour, Galveston, Texas, has earned a reputation as a windy city. Firstly, its location on Galveston Island, jutting out into the Gulf of Mexico, exposes it to persistent onshore winds. Moreover, the flat terrain surrounding the island provides minimal obstruction, allowing winds to flow freely.12. Wichita Falls, TexasAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 11.2 mphWichita Falls experiences a significant variation between its windy and calm seasons. While summers are hot, humid, and mostly clear with minimal wind, winters are cold and partly cloudy with significant wind gusts. Interestingly, the windiest period in Wichita Falls isn't winter but rather spring and early summer, with April taking the title as the month with the highest average wind speed.11. New York City, New YorkAverage Yearly Wind Speed: 11.2 mphNew York City's winds pick up significantly during the cooler months. While summers bring sweltering heat, humidity, and rain, winters transform the landscape with frigid temperatures, deep snow drifts, and winds.\u00a0 This windy season stretches from October to April in the city, with February being the month with the strongest average wind speeds.\u00a0 The rest of the year offers a respite from the blustery conditions, with partly cloudy skies year-round.10.
