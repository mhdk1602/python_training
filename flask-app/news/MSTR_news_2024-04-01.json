        "Content": "Shares of MicroStrategy stock (NASDAQ: MSTR) were rising yet again this week. The company that has staked its entire future on Bitcoin rose 11.9% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. With Bitcoin getting close to an all-time high, investors are making bets that the future of MicroStrategy is bright. The stock is up 500% in the past year.Here's why MicroStrategy's stock was up yet again this week.Using debt to buy BitcoinMicroStrategy pivoted in the last few years from a niche software business to using all its capital and taking on massive amounts of debt to purchase Bitcoin. That's its entire business strategy. And so far, this strategy has worked, as its shares are up 1,000% in the last five years, and its market cap is close to $30 billion. Earlier this month, it raised more convertible notes -- $600 million worth -- to increase its debt-fueled bet on Bitcoin.Investors in MicroStrategy are likely betting the company is a great way to get exposure to Bitcoin. But this logic may be flawed due to the stock's extreme premium to the actual Bitcoins it holds on its balance sheet. According to a recent short report from Kerrisdale Capital, MicroStrategy has recently traded at close to 2.5 times the actual value of the Bitcoins it holds, which makes little sense given the small size of the company's software subsidiary.The investment firm has decided to short MicroStrategy while simultaneously getting long Bitcoin in order to bet on this divergence. While retail investors should be hesitant about shorting any company, this is a clear example of how professional investors see MicroStrategy as overvalued.There are better ways to get exposure to BitcoinWith the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there are now much easier ways to get exposure to Bitcoin if you so desire. New ETFs have annual management fees of around 0.25%, which will barely eat into investment returns. It doesn't make sense for long-term, buy-and-hold investors to buy MicroStrategy to get exposure to Bitcoin if the actual Bitcoin on the balance sheet is worth a lot less.Story continuesMicroStrategy has done well in recent years. But it only has a small operating business and is truly just a bet on Bitcoin. When you can make a bet on Bitcoin at a significantly cheaper price by simply buying a different asset or investment vehicle like an ETF, why would anyone buy MicroStrategy at this price? It doesn't make sense. Stay far away from MicroStrategy for the time being. There are better ways to get exposure to Bitcoin.Should you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?Before you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Content": "The shorts are coming for MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), and investors reacted accordingly on Thursday -- well, at least one short seller, which made no bones about what it currently thinks of the tech company-turned-Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) accumulator. As a result, MicroStrategy's share price fell at a double-digit rate, closing more than 11% lower.Short the stock now, says investment firmKerrisdale Capital, an investment firm based in New York City, published a report lambasting MicroStrategy while recommending that investors go long on Bitcoin.Kerrisdale cheekily sub-titled the report \"Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL,\" a play on the \"hold on for dear life\" acronym that is a favorite of crypto investors.The firm is short on MicroStrategy and long on Bitcoin, and it did not mince words about the former. Due to the surging popularity of the leading cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy's shares have generally been on a sharp ride upwards lately.Kerrisdale is uncomfortable with this, writing thatThe bitcoin price currently implied by MicroStrategy's stock is now over $177,000, i.e., two and a half times the spot price of bitcoin. The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over.The investment firm also pointed out that MicroStrategy's original business, software analytics, currently comprises only 3% of its enterprise value.MicroStrategy has not yet officially responded to the Kerrisdale report.Bound tightly to BitcoinShort sellers tend to get outsized attention, as they are often scathingly critical of the stocks they are shorting. Yet Kerrisdale makes several valid points about MicroStrategy, particularly about how the shares were seen by some investors as a proxy for direct Bitcoin ownership. The company remains heavily dependent on the performance of Bitcoin since it's overwhelmingly its major asset, a situation that might not sit comfortably with many.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?Before you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.
