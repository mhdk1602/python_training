If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry, you can directly go to the 5 Most Expensive Countries To Get Netflix.\u00a0The Video Streaming Industry: An Overview\u00a0According to a report by Grand View Research, the global video streaming market was worth $106.83 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.5% from 2023 to 2030, driven by innovations in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. However, not everything seems to favor the industry right now. According to a Forbes article published on February 2, 2024, 45% of Americans canceled at least one of their streaming subscriptions in the last year because they found the costs to be high. 44% of Forbes' respondents reported that if prices increased, they were most likely to drop their Disney+ subscription, whereas another 40% chose Hulu. Even though Americans continue to pay for an average of 2.9 streaming subscriptions every month, it's clear that interest in the service is dwindling as prices continue to increase.\u00a0How is Netflix Doing?However, as the industry continues to struggle, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has surprised everyone by coming up high. On January 23, 2024, the company reported its statistics for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. According to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), it received 13.1 million subscribers during this period, the largest-ever number for Q4. This brought the total number of subscribers to 260 million. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also mentioned that a significant chunk of its Q4 growth could be attributed to its content and engagement.\u00a0The show Berlin aired on December 29, 2023, and received 46.6 million views in less than a month. Squid Game: The Challenge, a reality TV show based on Netflix\u2019s most-watched show ever, received 34.5 million views within its first two months. The Crown season finale, released on December 14, 2023, generated 30 million views. Other non-English entertainment also performed well; the third season of Lupin generated 50 million views, whereas the Spanish film Nowhere\u00a0received 85.7 million views. Even animated films managed to sustain a massive chunk of the audience; for example, Adam Sandler\u2019s Leo was watched by 108.1 million individuals.\u00a0Story continuesWithin the Q4 shareholder letter, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stated that starting in January 2025, WWE\u2019s Raw will become live on Netflix in the US, Canada, the UK, and Latin America, with other regions being added in the future. In the same month, Netflix will also start airing other WWE specials, shows, and live sports events, such as SmackDown, Wrestlemania, and Royal Rumble. Lastly, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also revealed that engagement had tripled for its games offerings in the last year. In Q4 of 2023, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) launched the Grand Theft Auto series from Rockstar Games, which has become its most successful gaming launch to date. So, even though the games section at Netflix is still new and growing, it does offer promising results for the company going forward. Check out 30 Best War Movies on Netflix Now. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) logged modest growth in Q4 2023. On January 23, the company reported that it generated a revenue of $8.83 billion in Q4 2023, up 12.49% year over year, and outperformed market consensus by $120.38 million. Here are some comments\u00a0 from the company's Q4 2023 earnings call:\"I'm going to say instead that we are thrilled to bring this WWE Live programming to our members around the world. WWE Raw is sports entertainment, which is right in the sweet spot of our sports business, which is the drama of sport. Think of this as 52 weeks of live programming every week, every year. It feeds our desire to expand our live event programming. But most importantly, fans love it. For decades, the WWE has grown this multigenerational fan base that we believe we could serve and we can grow. We believe that WWE has been historically under distributed outside of North America.And this is a global deal. So we can help them and they can help us build that fandom around the world. And not to - I should add that this should also add some fuel to our new and growing ad business. We're very excited about this deal.\"A Worthy Competitor\u00a0While Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to be one of the leading companies in the video streaming industry, a close competitor is Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video. On February 1, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) released its fourth-quarter results, and announced several promising achievements for Prime Video. Thursday Night Football (TNF) grew the total viewership for its second season by a 24% year-on-year growth. The Seahawks-Cowboys game, which took place on November 30 and generated 15.3 million in viewership, became Prime\u2019s most-watched TNF match ever. Additionally, the company generated a revenue of $169.69 billion, up 13.91% year over year and ahead of consensus by $3.70 billion. The group's advertising revenue grew by 27% year over year and amounted to $14.6 billion for the quarter. Here's what Andrew Jassy, the company's CEO, said during the Q4 2023 earnings call:\"We've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business. While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach and engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV, and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football.\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also reported that Amazon MGM Studios released 16 films and series in Q4. This included the second season of Invincible, which became the most-viewed animated series on Prime Video, globally speaking. More than 60 Amazon Originals from countries other than the US were also added to the roster in this quarter. The company also grew its sports-related offerings by adding several sports documentaries and new broadcast rights for various sports leagues, such as the National Women\u2019s Soccer League. On March 19, 2024, Amazon MGM Studios announced a partnership with the YouTuber Mr. Beast to release a reality competition series, Beast Games. The show will consist of 1,000 contestants fighting for a prize of $5 million, making this the biggest reality competition series in history based on single-prize value.\u00a0Despite the many cancellations in 2023, Nielsen published a report in January 2024 that showed\u00a0that Americans streamed content worth 21 million years in 2023. This was a 21% increase from 2022, when the value was 17 million years. Thus, even though streaming services are going through a bit of a rough patch due to rising prices, providers like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue finding ways to stay afloat. This often happens through price hikes, several of which have been seen across platforms in previous years.

        "Headline": "Why Netflix, Disney stocks have 'room to run'",
        "Content": "Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) stocks soared to 52-week highs driven by the booming streaming industry. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Media Analyst Geetha Ranganathan and Third Bridge Group Sector Analyst Jamie Lumley join Yahoo Finance's Market Domination to discuss the factors that have investors bullish on these stocks.Ranganathan believes these stocks still possess \"room to run.\" She highlights Netflix's subscriber growth initiatives, such as combating password sharing and introducing ad-supported subscription tiers. For Disney, Ranganathan credits the company's \"moderated streaming losses\" and its plans to achieve streaming profitability by year's end as catalysts driving stock gains.While acknowledging Netflix's \"very strong position\" in the streaming landscape, Lumley points out that competitors have also garnered investor optimism. He cites Disney as a prime example, citing its joint sports streaming venture, with sports as \"one of the most valuable assets\" in the streaming realm.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithVideo Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: Netflix and Disney shares hit 52 week highs this week. Is there still cause to be bullish on the names, or is the streaming sector primed for a correction? We are looking at how to navigate the big picture with the Yahoo Finance playbook.Joining us now is Geetha Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Media Analyst, alongside Jamie Lumley Third Bridge Group Sector Analyst.Geetha, I'm going to start with you. Is this as good as it gets, or is there a lot more room to run here?GEETHA RANGANATHAN: Thank you so much, Akiko, for having me. I still think there is room to run. Obviously, there is a lot of optimism right now as far as these two names are concerned. Both for, I think, slightly different reasons.So I think as far as Netflix is concerned, I think, the market generally sees a lot more momentum when it comes to adding subscribers. We know they have those two new initiatives in place. One is, of course, paid sharing, which is the password sharing kind of crackdown. And then you have the advertising tier.Story continuesAnd we did see them as a result of those ad, almost 30 million subscribers in 2023. Obviously, it's not probably going to be that high this year. But still, I mean, consensus expects 20, maybe even upwards of 22, 23 million new subscribers this year.And, then for Disney it's not so much subscriber growth itself, but rather moderating streaming losses and actually hitting profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. So for both these companies, there is obviously a lot of excitement, I think, that there definitely is room to run.JOSH LIPTON: Jamie, let's bring you in here and get your take as well. What do you say, Jamie, to those who argue, streaming wars, it's already over. Netflix one. What's your response to that?JAMIE LUMLEY: Well, I think it's important to understand that although Netflix is clearly in a very strong position, there still a lot of optimism around different other players within the streaming space looking at Disney. There is the potential that it can finally start to fully cut down on streaming losses.And then also take on new initiatives like the streaming sports venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery. I think a lot of people were surprised to see that there's now going to potentially be a new way to monetize sports content, which continues to be one of the most valuable assets in the space. On top of that as well, thinking with Disney, there is the upcoming launch of ESPN as a flagship streaming app. This could definitely bring more viewers into the fold and facilitate that transition from a legacy linear media business to a much more digital first direct to consumer business.So although there are definitely a lot of people just looking at Netflix, the margins that they've been able to achieve and really the strong 2023 that they had, it's not over for the other players in the media space."

We just don't expect the same outsized growth in the shares that we saw over 2023. I think what we're going to see is a shift to some extent from subscriber growth in 2023 that was really outsized.

Well, Wall Street is bullish on Netflix with 2/3s of analysts rating the stock a buy. Our next guest has been one of the most bullish price targets on the street and is nevertheless removing the streamer from a list of best ideas. Here with more, the analyst behind that call is Alicia Reece Wedbush Securities Vice President of Equity Research. It's great to see you here.So removing Netflix from the best ideas list, Do you still though, it sounds like, see upside for Netflix? And what does that look like?ALICIA REESE: Yeah. So, you know, we did-- we raised our target even more. We're still very bullish on the stock. We just don't expect the same outsized growth in the shares that we saw over 2023. I think what we're going to see is a shift to some extent from subscriber growth in 2023 that was really outsized, some-- a lot of that driven by the password sharing crackdown and the ad tier as it's limited churn. We think the ad tier will continue to limit churn over 2024 and beyond, but it'll also start too in the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 contribute to ARPPU.Story continuesAnd I think the story shifts from a subscriber growth story domestically to an ARPPU growth story domestically that, you know, subscriber growth should still, you know, maintain some really nice-- you know, a buffer from the International growth still. So we're still quite outperform on the stock. We just don't see the stock doubling again in 2024.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. You mentioned international. What levers do you expect Netflix to try and pull on the back half of this year at least, well, in the next three quarters of this year? My goodness, I'm just trying to, you know, speed past the second quarter. But anyway, as we think about the rest of this year, What levers can they pull internationally?ALICIA REESE: Well, they-- I think they have still, you know-- our survey that we did recently said that about 6% of at least domestic Netflix subscribers are still sharing their password and have not yet been cracked down on. And so I don't think Netflix is going to do that all at once. I don't think you're going to see that in one single quarter. They're trickling that in because it's adding, you know, a nice buffer for new subscriber additions for those who get kicked off and also for families who choose the extra member feature, and that's a nice boost to ARPPU.So I think we'll continue to see that just in, you know, diminishing rate that we saw in 2023. There's also the ad tier. The ad tier is nearing accretion so that incremental ARPPU that you get from the ad tier, it's-- you know, it hasn't, you know, added anything to ARPPU yet. It's reaching parity. I think it will-- In the back half, it'll start becoming accretive, and then in 2025, it'll be more meaningfully accretive, and that can grow pretty substantially beyond 2025. So it's still a really interesting story here, and there's quite a bit of growth in all aspects. And then, like you said, the international, that, you know, just growing the subscriber base.I think there's not as much room in India, but certainly plenty of room left in Latin America and APAC.SEANA SMITH: And what's that going to do to Netflix's bottom line do you think, Alicia?ALICIA REESE: Yeah. So the ad tier accretion, that drives revenue, that drives earnings, that drives free cash flow. So that's a hugely positive story. You know, consensus is calling for a doubling of EPS from 23 to 25, or 26. And we think that's absolutely reasonable. A lot of that is just coming from, you know, the extra member feature being entirely incremental revenue, and then, you know, the accretion from the ad tier being entirely incremental revenue and at a very high margin.You know, they're not spending, you know, terribly much on that. And as they add more sports and more sports-like content, like the WWE, that'll give them a lot more opportunity to advertise and not just on the ad tier, on the, you know, premium tiers as well."

But even if you're 10 years away, that's still a long enough time horizon to make focusing intensely on headlines and the minute details of analyst estimates a distraction.Thinking long term is becoming more of a rarity these days. The introduction of Robinhood more than a decade ago started a race to zero when it came to trading fees, which made it free and effortless to trade.Add this to the constant flow of news, and it makes sense why the average holding period of a stock these days can be measured in months. That's in stark contrast to the average holding period of over eight years in the 1950s. The average investor is not only encouraged by the news cycle and advertising to constantly be tinkering with their portfolios, but they have the tool (the smartphone in their pocket) to do so quickly.This is where Buffett's approach stands out from the crowd. While it might be exciting and fun to try and predict short-term price movements, it's usually a losing proposition. Almost anything can happen in the short term. Consequently, investors who have multiyear outlooks have a sizable and growing advantage because stocks tend to rise over long periods. It's that simple.Story continuesBeing a successful investor requires having the right skill set and temperament, like how to properly analyze financial statements, having the conviction to place a bet when the risk-reward is attractive, and reducing emotional influences. But it also means picking the spots where there's less attention being placed, and that's with a time horizon of multiple years out.Image source: Getty Images.Focus on the most important factorsNow that we've established that focusing on the long term is wise, the next question centers on how to identify what makes a winning stock. When you think about the next five years, as opposed to the next five months, it forces you to focus on the most important factors that drive business results. I'm talking about things like the presence of an economic moat, solid growth potential, improving margins, and a reasonable valuation. These are favorable ingredients that should result in an investment working out well.Netflix is the perfect example of a stock that was left for dead due to the dominance of a short-term perspective that took over investor sentiment at the time. The company lost a total of 1.2 million members in the first six months of 2022, following a surge in demand during the depths of the pandemic. Investors worried that intensifying competition spelled the beginning of the end of Netflix's run atop the streaming landscape.Investors bid the shares down to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15 in the summer of 2022. In the last 18 months, the stock is up 157% (as of March 21), as the market has become enthusiastic once again following a string of strong financial results that saw Netflix add new members at a rapid clip.To be fair, hindsight is always 20/20. But the Netflix example shows you that even some of the most dominant industry-leading enterprises can see their stocks get hammered after a couple of quarterly financial results come in below expectations. This is a great example of how a long-term mindset can pay off and benefit your portfolio.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team\u00a0has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
