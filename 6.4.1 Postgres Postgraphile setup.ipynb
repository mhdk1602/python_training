    "# Streamlining GraphQL APIs with PostGraphile and Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Embarking on a journey to explore the synergies between GraphQL and PostgreSQL, we have chosen to leverage PostGraphile, a powerful tool that bridges the gap between PostgreSQL databases and GraphQL APIs, promising rapid and seamless development cycles. Here's how our expedition is set to unfold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Up a Docker Container**: We initiate our project by orchestrating a Docker container equipped with a PostgreSQL service. This foundational step creates a robust and manageable development environment, paving the way for seamless integration with PostGraphile.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Idempotency**: As we venture deeper, we turn our focus towards grasping the pivotal concept of idempotency. Understanding its significance in database initialization scripts is crucial, as it ensures that our setup scripts can be executed multiple times without causing adverse effects, thereby promising stability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading Tables**: As we progress, our attention shifts to formulating and executing Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts. This step is vital in initializing our PostgreSQL database with the requisite tables, ensuring operations adhere to idempotent principles, thereby fostering consistency and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initializing PostGraphile**: With our database structured, we now focus on initializing PostGraphile. This powerful tool automatically generates a GraphQL schema from our PostgreSQL database, significantly simplifying the setup process and facilitating seamless querying capabilities, all while maintaining the flexibility to customize and extend the schema as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Querying with a GraphQL Client**: In the final leg of our journey, we explore the querying capabilities facilitated by PostGraphile. We will navigate through the process of crafting and executing queries using a GraphQL client, enabling flexible and efficient data retrieval from our database, thus showcasing the powerful integration of GraphQL and PostgreSQL orchestrated through Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide, you will be adept at setting up a streamlined GraphQL API using PostGraphile and Docker, marking a significant milestone in your journey with GraphQL and relational databases.y.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up a Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial phase of our project, we will be setting up a Docker container to host our PostgreSQL service. But why choose Docker in the first place? Here are a few compelling reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Consistency**: Docker ensures that your application runs the same regardless of where Docker is running. This eliminates the classic problem of \"it works on my machine\" scenarios, fostering consistency across development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Isolation and Security**: Docker containers are isolated from each other, which means that they have their own environments and file systems. This isolation enhances security by containing any potential application breaches to the individual container.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ease of Setup and Use**: Setting up databases can sometimes be a complex task involving many steps. Docker containers can encapsulate all these complexities, allowing you to set up services like PostgreSQL with just a few commands. This ease of use accelerates the development cycle significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Efficiency**: Docker containers share the host system's kernel, rather than including their own operating system. This makes them lightweight and efficient in terms of system resources, which allows running many containers on a host machine without straining system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Community and Ecosystem**: Docker has a vibrant community and a rich ecosystem of pre-built images available on Docker Hub. This means you can leverage the work of thousands of others to quickly and easily set up and deploy services.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these advantages in mind, our first step is to set up a Docker container running a PostgreSQL service. This process involves creating a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the service configurations and using Docker Compose commands to manage the lifecycle of our containers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our PostgreSQL service configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "version: '3.1'\n",
    "\n",

    "### Structuring Your Docker Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve into idempotency, it's important to understand the structure of our Docker project and the purpose behind each component. Let's break down the elements of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Postgres Folder**\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder serves as the central location where all PostgreSQL related files are stored. It helps in organizing your project by segregating the database files from other components of your application. Here’s a closer look at the important files and folders within the `postgres` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### a. **Dockerfile**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dockerfile` is a blueprint that contains instructions for building a Docker image, which in turn is used to create containers. In our case, the `Dockerfile` includes instructions for setting up a PostgreSQL service. It specifies the base image to use (PostgreSQL in our case), environment variables, and other configurations necessary to run the PostgreSQL service.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Use the official image as a parent image\n",
    "FROM postgres:latest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the working directory in the container to /app\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app\n",
    "COPY . /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make port 5432 available to the world outside this container\n",
    "EXPOSE 5432</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### b. **init Folder**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `init` folder contains SQL scripts that are executed when the PostgreSQL container is initialized. These scripts are used to set up the database schema, create tables, and seed initial data. The scripts in this folder are executed in alphabetical order, hence naming them as `01_init.sql`, `02_init.sql`, etc., helps in controlling the execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### c. **data Folder**\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder is mapped to the data directory of the PostgreSQL service inside the container. By mapping this folder as a volume, the data stored in the database persists even when the container is removed, ensuring that you don't lose your data when you bring down the Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### d. **init.sql Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Files like `01_init.sql` and `02_init.sql` in the `init` folder contain SQL scripts to initialize the database. These scripts can include commands to create databases, tables, and populate them with initial data."

    "### Understanding Idempotency\n",
    "\n",
    "As we venture deeper into setting up our Dockerized PostgreSQL service, it's critical to grasp the concept of idempotency, a fundamental property that ensures the stability and reliability of our database initialization scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is Idempotency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of database operations, idempotency refers to the property of certain operations where they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. In simpler terms, an idempotent operation, when executed multiple times, has the same effect as if it were executed just once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is Idempotency Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reliable Initialization**: Ensuring that our initialization scripts are idempotent means that we can run them multiple times without worrying about adverse effects or inconsistencies in our database. This is particularly useful during the development phase where the database setup might change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Recovery**: In case of errors or interruptions during the initialization process, idempotent scripts allow for safe retries without the risk of duplicating data or corrupting the database state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplified Maintenance**: Idempotent scripts simplify maintenance and updates, as they can be rerun safely whenever changes are made, without requiring complex checks or conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementing Idempotency in SQL Scripts**\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement idempotency in SQL scripts, we can use conditional statements to check the existence of objects (like tables or databases) before attempting to create them. For instance, before creating a table, we can check if it already exists, and only create it if it doesn't. Here’s how you can do this in PostgreSQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DO\n",
    "$$\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'mytable' AND table_schema = 'public') THEN\n",
    "        CREATE TABLE public.mytable (\n",
    "            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "            name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    END IF;\n",
    "END\n",
    "$$;\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "289945ca",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In this script, the IF NOT EXISTS clause checks if the table 'mytable' already exists in the 'public' schema, and if not, it proceeds to create the table. This ensures that the script is idempotent and can be run multiple times without causing errors or duplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move forward, we will be applying the principle of idempotency to our database initialization scripts, ensuring a robust and reliable setup process.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **earnings** and **ticker_daily**: These tables also reference the `stocks` table through the `ticker` attribute. They can be populated in parallel after the `stocks` table is loaded as they contain information on earnings and daily stock prices, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ticker_intraday**: This table is dependent on the `ticker_daily` table as it contains intraday price data linked to the daily price records. Therefore, it should be loaded after the `ticker_daily` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **portfolio**: Lastly, we populate the `portfolio` table, which records individual transactions and references the `stocks` table through the `ticker` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the data loading process, we will use DataFrames for each table. The DataFrames will be populated with data, and we can then use the `to_sql` method from the pandas library to load data into the PostgreSQL database."

    "# Introduction to PostGraphile\n",
    "\n",
    "PostGraphile is a powerful tool that serves as a bridge between PostgreSQL and GraphQL, enabling rapid development cycles. It automatically generates a highly-performant and extensible GraphQL API from a PostgreSQL database schema. Here are some key features and benefits of using PostGraphile:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Schema Generation:** PostGraphile inspects your PostgreSQL schema to automatically generate a GraphQL schema. This means you can have a GraphQL API up and running in no time, without having to manually define types, queries, and mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database-Driven Development:** It encourages a database-driven development approach, where the database schema serves as the single source of truth. This promotes a clean database design and allows you to leverage the full power of SQL and PostgreSQL's features in your GraphQL API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Optimizations:** PostGraphile includes several performance optimizations to ensure that your GraphQL API is fast and efficient. It supports batch querying to reduce database query overhead and employs smart query planning to fetch data in the most efficient way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-Time Features:** It offers real-time features with live queries, allowing clients to receive real-time updates as the data changes in the database, fostering interactive and dynamic client applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fine-Grained Access Control:** PostGraphile integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL's role-based access control and row-level security features, allowing you to implement fine-grained access control policies directly in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extensibility:** It provides a powerful plugin system that allows you to customize and extend your GraphQL schema with additional types, queries, mutations, and more.\n",

    "### Integrating PostGraphile with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully setting up our PostgreSQL service in a Docker container, we further enhanced our setup by integrating PostGraphile, a tool that automatically generates a GraphQL API from a PostgreSQL schema. Here's how we achieved this integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Updating the Docker Compose File\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by adding a new service definition for the PostGraphile service in our `docker-compose.yml` file. This service uses the official PostGraphile Docker image and is configured to communicate with our PostgreSQL service. The significant elements of the service definition include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image**: Specifies the official PostGraphile Docker image.\n",
    "- **Ports**: Maps port 5000 inside the container to port 5001 on the host machine, allowing us to access the GraphQL API at `http://localhost:5001/graphql`.\n",

    "In this section, we will explore the powerful querying capabilities of GraphQL, which allows for flexible and efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding GraphQL Queries**: GraphQL queries, a cornerstone of GraphQL operations, offer a flexible approach to data retrieval. Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL allows clients to dictate the structure of the response, enabling precise data fetching without over-fetching or under-fetching information. Let's delve deeper into the anatomy of GraphQL queries, focusing on aspects such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fields: The keys in the query structure that map to the data you want to retrieve.\n",
    "- Arguments: Parameters that you can pass to fields to filter or modify the data response.\n",
    "- Aliases: Allow renaming fields in a query to avoid conflicts or to request the same field with different arguments.\n",
    "- Fragments: Reusable pieces of queries that let you create complex queries more easily.\n",

    "## Schema Transformation to GraphQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of generating a GraphQL API from a PostgreSQL schema using PostGraphile, several transformations occur to adapt the SQL schema to GraphQL conventions. One prominent transformation is the conversion of naming conventions from snake_case (common in PostgreSQL) to camelCase (common in GraphQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a table named stocks in your PostgreSQL database would be represented as allStocks in the GraphQL schema for querying multiple records, following the GraphQL convention of using camelCase for field names. Similarly, fields with names like created_at in PostgreSQL would be transformed to createdAt in GraphQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Query Fields and Pagination</b>\n",

    "\n",
    "- first: Limits the results to a specified number of first records.\n",
    "- last: Limits the results to a specified number of last records.\n",
    "- offset: Skips a specified number of records before returning the results.\n",
    "- before: Used for cursor-based pagination to get records before a specific cursor.\n",
    "- after: Used for cursor-based pagination to get records after a specific cursor.\n",
    "- orderBy: Allows you to specify the order of results based on one or more fields.\n",
    "- condition: Allows you to specify conditions to filter the results based on field values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fields in the Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "- nodes: This field returns a list of records directly, where each record is represented as an object with fields corresponding to the columns in the stocks table. You can select the fields you want to retrieve within the nodes field.\n",
    "- edges: This field returns a list of edges, where each edge contains a node (representing a record) and potentially additional information such as a cursor for pagination. The node within each edge has the same structure as the nodes in the nodes field.\n",
    "- pageInfo: Contains information about the current page of results, including details like whether there are more results available, and cursors for the first and last records on the page. This information is useful for implementing cursor-based pagination.\n",
    "- totalCount: Returns the total count of records that match the query, irrespective of any pagination limits applied to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example query that uses some of these fields and arguments:</b>\n",
