    "## Migration to Hasura\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning from PostGraphile to Hasura involves a series of critical steps that are pivotal to ensuring a seamless migration process. Here, we delineate the comprehensive steps undertaken during the migration:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Updating Docker Compose File**\n",
    "To initiate the migration, the `docker-compose.yml` file was updated to include the Hasura service configuration. This involved specifying the Hasura image, defining the environment variables, and delineating the necessary dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Acquiring the Latest Hasura Image from Docker Hub**\n",
    "Before making alterations to the Docker Compose file, it was imperative to procure the latest Hasura image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine). This step ensured utilization of the most recent and stable version of Hasura.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Establishing Hasura Connection**\n",
    "Post the Docker Compose setup, the next stride was to forge a connection between Hasura and the database. This stage encompassed configuring the database URL and other vital connection parameters in the Hasura console.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Tracking Tables in Hasura**\n",
    "Subsequent to establishing the connection, all requisite tables were tracked in the Hasura console to activate the GraphQL API. This procedure allowed Hasura to autonomously generate GraphQL schemas predicated on the tracked tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Modifying GraphQL Queries**\n",
    "A pivotal step in the migration was the modification of existing GraphQL queries in the application to conform to the new schema generated by Hasura. This entailed updating field names and reshaping query structures to align with Hasura conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Updating Apollo Client Setup (`apollo-client.ts`)**\n",
    "An essential step in the migration was updating the Apollo Client setup in the `apollo-client.ts` file. This involved setting the new GraphQL endpoint URL and configuring the headers to include the Hasura admin secret for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Modifying Components and Pages (`index.tsx`)**\n",
    "Further, adjustments were made to components and pages, including `index.tsx`, to adapt to the modified GraphQL queries. This step involved updating data destructuring and JSX elements to align with the new data structure returned by the updated queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Understanding Schema Inference Differences**\n",
    "\n",
    "During migration, grasping the disparities in how PostGraphile and Hasura infer PostgreSQL tables was vital. Here, we underline the primary distinctions in a comparative table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect                  | PostGraphile                                                           | Hasura                                                                                       |\n",
    "|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Naming Conventions**  | Predominantly utilizes CamelCase for table and column names.           | Prefers snake_case for table and column names, mirroring the database structure directly.    |\n",
    "| **Relationships**       | Inferences relationships automatically through foreign key constraints.| Demands manual setup for relationships in the console, granting more control to the user.   |\n",
    "| **Customization**       | Provides extensive customization via a robust plugin system.           | Facilitates customization through actions, remote schemas, and plugins.                     |\n",
    "| **Permissions**        | Manages permissions through custom plugins and PostgreSQL roles.      | Incorporates a built-in role-based permission system for granular access control.           |\n",
    "\n",
    "This table delineates the fundamental distinctions in schema inference between PostGraphile and Hasura, offering insights into the anticipations during the migration process.\n"

    "# Transition from PostGraphile to Hasura: A Detailed Transition Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "In our recent endeavor to transition from PostGraphile to Hasura, we undertook several significant modifications to enhance the efficiency and performance of our database management system. Here we delineate the pivotal changes that were brought about and the rationale behind them:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Docker Compose File Modifications**\n",
    "\n",
    "We initiated the migration process by making alterations in the `docker-compose.yaml` file to introduce the Hasura services. This foundational step was vital to set up the environment for Hasura to interact seamlessly with the existing databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  hasura:\n",
    "    image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.10\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - \"8080:8080\"\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: postgres://username:password@postgres:5432/mydatabase\n",
    "      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: \"true\"\n",
    "    depends_on:\n",
    "      - \"postgres\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifying the Hasura image version ensures we are utilizing the features and optimizations available in that version.\n",
    "- Setting up environment variables to establish a secure connection between Hasura and the Postgres database.\n",
    "- Enabling the Hasura console facilitates easier management and visualization of the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. GraphQL Query Refactoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning to Hasura necessitated a re-evaluation and modification of our GraphQL queries to align with Hasura's conventions, which, while being more direct, also offered a cleaner and less nested query structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Before (PostGraphile)**\n",
    "```graphql\n",
    "query GetPortfolioSummary {\n",
    "  allPortfolioSummaries {\n",
    "    nodes {\n",
    "      ticker\n",
    "      totalShares\n",
    "      totalAssetValue\n",
    "      asOfDate\n",
    "      stockByTicker {\n",
    "        name\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **After (Hasura)**\n",
    "```graphql\n",
    "query GetPortfolioSummary {\n",
    "  portfolio_summary {\n",
    "    ticker\n",
    "    total_shares\n",
    "    total_asset_value\n",
    "    as_of_date\n",
    "    stock {\n",
    "      name\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplifying the query structure by removing the `nodes` and `stockByTicker` levels, making the queries more straightforward and easier to manage.\n",
    "- Aligning the field names with Hasura's conventions, which use snake_case as opposed to camelCase, offering a more uniform and standard approach to query formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Frontend File Adjustments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the GraphQL query adjustments, we updated the frontend files to integrate the newly structured queries. This involved modifying the `useQuery` hooks and the state and effect hooks to accommodate the data structure changes brought about by Hasura.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes in `index.tsx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updated `useQuery` hooks to integrate new GraphQL queries.\n",
    "- Modified state and effect hooks to handle the altered data structure returned by Hasura.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensuring smooth integration of the new queries into the frontend without disrupting the existing functionalities.\n",
    "- Leveraging Hasura's capabilities to enhance the frontend's performance and data retrieval efficiency.\n"
