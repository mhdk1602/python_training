    "# Schema Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema modeling is an important aspect of data engineering, as it helps structure your data in a way that is efficient for querying and easy to understand. There are different types of schema modeling approaches, such as star schema, snowflake schema, and hybrid schema (which combines elements of both star and snowflake). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss each of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Star Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `star` schema, a central fact table is connected to one or more dimension tables via foreign key relationships. The fact table contains quantitative data (e.g., sales, revenue) and keys to join with the dimension tables. Dimension tables store descriptive attributes (e.g., customer information, product details) and are usually denormalized, meaning they contain redundant data to minimize the number of joins required during querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Star schema is a popular choice for data warehouse design because of its simplicity and query performance advantages. Here's an example of a star schema in the context of a retail sales data warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a retail company wants to analyze its sales data. A typical star schema for this scenario would have a central fact table (fact_sales) and several dimension tables, such as dim_date, dim_product, dim_customer, and dim_store.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fact_sales (fact table): This table contains quantitative data (measures) about each sale, such as:\n",
    "- sales_id (primary key)\n",
    "- date_id (foreign key to Dim_Date)\n",
    "- product_id (foreign key to Dim_Product)\n",
    "- customer_id (foreign key to Dim_Customer)\n",
    "- store_id (foreign key to Dim_Store)\n",
    "- quantity_sold\n",
    "- total_price\n",
    "\n",
    "2. dim_date (dimension table): This table stores information about dates, such as:\n",
    "- date_id (primary key)\n",
    "- date\n",
    "- day_of_week\n",
    "- day_of_month\n",
    "- month\n",
    "- quarter\n",
    "- year\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. dim_product (dimension table): This table contains information about products, such as:\n",
    "- product_id (primary key)\n",
    "- product_name\n",
    "- category\n",
    "- subcategory\n",
    "- brand\n",
    "- color\n",
    "- size\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. dim_customer (dimension table): This table stores information about customers, such as:\n",
    "- customer_id (primary key)\n",
    "- first_name\n",
    "- last_name\n",
    "- email\n",
    "- phone\n",
    "- address\n",
    "- city\n",
    "- state\n",
    "- country\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. dim_store (dimension table): This table holds information about store locations, such as:\n",
    "- store_id (primary key)\n",
    "- store_name\n",
    "- address\n",
    "- city\n",
    "- state\n",
    "- country\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snowflake Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `snowflake` schema, the central fact table is surrounded by multiple dimension tables, which can further be connected to other dimension tables, forming a structure resembling a snowflake. Unlike the star schema, snowflake schema normalizes data, reducing data redundancy at the cost of more complex queries due to an increased number of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snowflake schema is favored for its efficient data storage since it minimizes data duplication by separating data into related tables. Here's an example of a snowflake schema in the context of a retail sales data warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a retail company wishes to analyze its sales data. A typical snowflake schema for this scenario would consist of a central fact table (fact_sales) and several dimension tables including Dim_customer, Dim_Contact, Dim_Address, Dim_Country, Dim_Date, Dim_day_details, dim_store, dim_product, dim_brand, and dim_category.\n",

    "### Hybrid Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid schema combines the elements of both star and snowflake schemas, aiming to utilize the strengths of both. It features a central fact table connected to a mixture of normalized and denormalized dimension tables. This offers a balanced approach, optimizing storage efficiency while maintaining a reasonable query performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a retail sales data warehouse, a hybrid schema might look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a retail company seeks to scrutinize its sales data. The hybrid schema for this scenario could consist of a central fact table (fact_sales) and several dimension tables such as dim_customer, dim_contact, dim_address, dim_date, dim_store, and dim_product.\n",
    "\n",

    "- <b>Scenario:</b> A small e-commerce startup wants to set up a data warehouse to analyze sales data to make informed decisions on inventory management and marketing strategies.\n",
    "- <b>Criteria:</b> Given that the startup is small, the amount of data is not enormous. A star schema would allow for simple, straightforward queries with faster response times, making it easier for the startup to quickly gain insights without getting entangled in complex data relationships.\n",
    "- <b>Example Query:</b> Determining the best-selling products in a particular month, which can be quickly found by performing a few joins between the fact and dimension tables.\n",

    "- <b>Scenario:</b> A multinational corporation wants to analyze global sales and customer data, which includes a vast amount of details such as customer demographics, sales transactions, and product information distributed across various countries.\n",
    "- <b>Criteria:</b> Given the large scale of data and the necessity to store data efficiently, a snowflake schema is chosen. It minimizes data redundancy, thus saving storage costs. The corporation has the resources to manage the complexity of the schema and can afford slightly slower query times in exchange for more detailed and multifaceted analyses.\n",
    "- <b>Example Query:</b> Analyzing the buying patterns of customers in different countries, which requires detailed data from several normalized tables, facilitating a deeper analysis of the global customer base.\n",

    "- <b>Criteria:</b> The organization deals with a diverse set of data, where some aspects require detailed analyses (like research data) while others need quicker query times (like patient records). A hybrid schema is chosen to balance the storage efficiency and query performance, catering to the diverse data analysis needs without compromising on storage space or query speed.\n",
