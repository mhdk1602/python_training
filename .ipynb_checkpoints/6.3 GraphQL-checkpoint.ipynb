    "# Introduction to GraphQL\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. It provides a more complete and understandable description of the data in your API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. Developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, GraphQL supports reading, writing, and subscribing to changes to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Precise Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "With GraphQL, you can request only the data you need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching of data, a common issue encountered with REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Single Endpoint\n",
    "Unlike REST, where each resource has a separate endpoint, GraphQL APIs expose a single endpoint for all interactions, streamlining the communication process and making API management easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a Python script using the requests library to query the GitHub GraphQL API. This script will fetch details of a GitHub repository. Before running the script, make sure to set the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable before running the script."

    "<b>Flexibility:</b> Lesser flexibility as the structure of the response is predetermined by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3. Real-Time Data with Subscriptions\n",
    "GraphQL offers subscriptions that allow clients to receive real-time updates when data changes, providing a dynamic and responsive API interaction experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL Subscriptions are a way to push data from the server to the clients that choose to listen to real-time messages from the server. Subscriptions are built on top of the WebSocket protocol, which allows for continuous two-way communication between the client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase this example we will set about creating a local graphQL server using Apollo-server\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Setting Up Docker\n",
    "Before we dive into creating our GraphQL server, we first need to set up a Docker environment. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Install Docker:</b> If not already installed, download and install Docker on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Create a Dockerfile:</b> In your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile with the following content to set up a Node.js environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Use the official Node.js image\n",
    "FROM node:14\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a directory for the app\n",
    "WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy package.json and package-lock.json\n",
    "COPY package*.json ./\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install dependencies\n",
    "RUN npm install\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy the local files to the container\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expose the port the app runs on\n",
    "EXPOSE 4000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the command to run the app\n",
    "CMD [ \"node\", \"server.js\" ]\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Create a .dockerignore File:</b> Create a .dockerignore file in your project directory with the following content to prevent node_modules and other unnecessary files from being copied to the Docker image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>node_modules\n",
    "npm-debug.log\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Setting Up a Local GraphQL Server\n",
    "Now, we will proceed to set up our GraphQL server inside a Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Create a New Node.js Project:</b> In your project directory, create a `package.json` file with basic details about the project. You can generate this file by running `npm init -y` in a Node.js environment and then copying it to your project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Install Necessary Packages:</b> Specify the necessary packages (apollo-server and graphql) in the dependencies section of the package.json file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "\"dependencies\": {\n",
    "  \"apollo-server\": \"^3.5.0\",\n",
    "  \"graphql\": \"^15.8.0\",\n",
    "  \"graphql-subscriptions\": \"^2.0.0\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Create a GraphQL Schema and Resolvers:</b> Create a file named `schema.js` in your project directory and add the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">const</font> { gql } = require(<font color=\"green\">'apollo-server'</font>);\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">const</font> typeDefs = gql<font color=\"green\">`\n",
    "  type Message {\n",
    "    id: ID!\n",
    "    user: String!\n",
    "    content: String!\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  type Subscription {\n",
    "    messageAdded: Message\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  type Query {\n",
    "    messages: [Message]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  type Mutation {\n",
    "    addMessage(user: String!, content: String!): Message\n",
    "  }\n",
    "`</font>;\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"magenta\">module</font>.exports = typeDefs;\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define a Message type with fields id, user, and content.\n",
    "- We define a Subscription type with a messageAdded field that returns a Message type. This will be used to push real-time updates to subscribers.\n",
    "- We define a Query type with a messages field to fetch all messages.\n",
    "- We define a Mutation type with an addMessage field to add new messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a file named `resolvers.js` in your project directory and add the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "const { pubsub } = require('./server');\n",
    "let messages = [];\n",
    "let idCount = 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "const resolvers = {\n",
    "  Mutation: {\n",
    "    addMessage: (_, { user, content }, { pubsub }) => {\n",
    "      const message = { id: idCount++, user, content };\n",
    "      messages.push(message);\n",
    "      pubsub.publish('MESSAGE_ADDED', { messageAdded: message });\n",
    "      return message;\n",
    "    },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  Subscription: {\n",
    "    messageAdded: {\n",
    "      subscribe: (_, __, { pubsub }) => pubsub.asyncIterator(['MESSAGE_ADDED']),\n",
    "    },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = resolvers;\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define a messages array to hold message objects and an idCount variable to assign unique IDs to messages.\n",
    "- We define resolvers for the messages query and the addMessage mutation.\n",
    "- We define a resolver for the messageAdded subscription to handle real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3. Setting Up the Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will create the server file where we will set up Apollo Server and initialize it with the schema and resolvers we created in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Create a Server File:</b> Create a file named `server.js` in your project directory and add the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');\n",
    "const { PubSub } = require('graphql-subscriptions');\n",
    "const typeDefs = require('./schema');\n",
    "const pubsub = new PubSub();\n",
    "const resolvers = require('./resolvers');\n",
    "\n",
    "const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers, context: { pubsub } });\n",
    "\n",
    "server.listen().then(({ url, subscriptionsUrl }) => {\n",
    "  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);\n",
    "  console.log(`🚀 Subscriptions ready at ${subscriptionsUrl}`);\n",
    "});\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Building and Running the Docker Container\n",
    "Now that our GraphQL server setup is complete, we will build and run our Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Build the Docker Image:</b> In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the command docker build -t graphql-server . to build the Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Run the Docker Container:</b> After the build completes, run the command docker run -p 4000:4000 graphql-server to start the container. The GraphQL server should now be running at `http://localhost:4000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Schema Creation: We started using makeExecutableSchema to create the GraphQL schema manually, which is then used in both the GraphQL HTTP middleware and the WebSocket server.\n",
