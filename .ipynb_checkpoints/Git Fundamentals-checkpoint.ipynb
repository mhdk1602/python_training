    "## Introduction to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello there! If you're new to data engineering, or are just looking for a way to manage and collaborate on code, you've come to the right place. In this guide, I will introduce you to `GitHub`, a platform that's essential for any data engineer (or anyone working with code for that matter!). From setting up your first repository to making your contributions count with verified commits, we’ve got it all covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GitHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "`GitHub` is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It allows you to work on projects collaboratively with others, and keeps track of all the changes made to the code. It's built on top of Git, which is a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds (yes, the creator of Linux!). GitHub adds a web-based interface to Git, and provides several collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start using GitHub, you need to have an account. Head over to <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and sign up for a new account if you don't have one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Install Git**\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is built on Git, so you need to have Git installed on your machine. Go to the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\" target=\"_blank\">Git downloads page</a> and install Git for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Configure Git**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have Git installed, open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows), and configure Git with your name and email address. These will be used to identify you as the author when you make commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning the Training Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you've found a training repository on GitHub that you'd like to use. The first thing you should do is create a copy of that repository on your local machine, and this is known as ‘cloning’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the following command in your terminal, replacing the URL with the repository's URL:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "git clone <a href=\"https://github.com/bcg-x-engineering/bcg-x-DE-training.git\">https://github.com/bcg-x-engineering/bcg-x-DE-training.git</a>\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you've got a local copy of the repository!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The main (default) branch usually contains the stable code, and other branches are used to develop new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new branch by executing:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "git checkout -b my-new-branch\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Your First Commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you're on your branch, let's make some changes to the files. Once you've made your changes, you'll want to 'commit' them. This is like taking a snapshot of your files at this point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to stage the files that you want to commit. To do this, run:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "git add filename\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "Or, to stage all the files that have been modified, you can use:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "Now that your files are staged, you can make the commit with:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "git commit -m \"A descriptive message about the changes\"\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pushing Changes to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "After committing your changes locally, you need to send them to GitHub. You can do this with the 'push' command:\n",
    "\n",
    "git push origin my-new-branch\n",
    "\n",
    "This sends your changes to the GitHub repository under your new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've pushed your branch to GitHub, you can ask for your changes to be merged into the main branch. This is done through a Pull Request (PR).\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>    \n",
    "Go to the GitHub page for the repository.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "    Click on <a href=\"https://github.com/bcg-x-engineering/bcg-x-DE-training/pulls\">'Pull requests'.</a>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "Click on <a href=\"https://github.com/bcg-x-engineering/bcg-x-DE-training/compare\">'New Pull Request'.</a>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "Select the branch you want to merge from and the branch you want to merge into.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "Add a title and a description for your PR.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "Click 'Create Pull Request'.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ul>    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Verified Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "Verified commits are an extra layer of security to ensure that the commits coming from you are indeed authored by you. This is done by signing your commits using GPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "    First, you need to generate a new GPG key. <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key\">Follow these instructions.</a>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "    Add the GPG key to your GitHub account.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "    Tell Git about your signing key with:\n",
    "    <pre>\n",
    "    <code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "    git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID\n",
    "    </code>\n",
    "    </pre>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "    Now, use the -S option with git commit to sign your commits:\n",
    "    <pre>\n",
    "    <code class=\"shell\">\n",
    "    git commit -S -m \"Your commit message\"\n",
    "    </code>\n",
    "    </pre>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "</ul>"
