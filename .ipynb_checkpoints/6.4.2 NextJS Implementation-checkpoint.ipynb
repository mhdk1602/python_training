    "# Building a Stock Trading Platform with GraphQL, PostGraphile, and Next.js\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to showcase advanced data engineering techniques by integrating a front-end application developed with Next.js with a backend PostgreSQL database using GraphQL and PostGraphile. Here we outline the main objectives and the changes implemented in the docker-compose file and the initialization of the react app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Showcasing GraphQL Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Using PostGraphile and GraphiQL:*\n",
    "By setting up PostGraphile, we automatically generate a high-performance GraphQL API from our PostgreSQL database. This enables us to harness the power of GraphQL to query our data with more flexibility and efficiency. The GraphiQL interface serves as a playground to test and visualize different GraphQL queries, facilitating the backend development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Integration with Apollo Client:*\n",
    "To connect our Next.js front-end with the GraphQL API, we will be using Apollo Client. It will allow us to fetch, cache, and modify the data in our database seamlessly, making the management of the state in our app more straightforward and more scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Demonstrating Data Engineering Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Database Integration:*\n",
    "We demonstrate how to integrate a PostgreSQL database with a front-end application, emphasizing maintaining data integrity and optimizing query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Front-end Development with Next.js:*\n",
    "Our project showcases how to develop a dynamic and responsive front-end using Next.js, a popular React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Docker-Compose File Modifications**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Introduction of Next.js Service:*\n",
    "We added a new service to our docker-compose file to create a container for the Next.js application. We used the latest version of the node image to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. The working directory is set to `/app`, and the necessary environment variables and volume mappings are defined to integrate with the other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Network Configuration:*\n",
    "All the services are connected on a custom network, `my-network`, which allows them to communicate with each other seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  nextjs:\n",
    "    image: node:latest\n",
    "    container_name: nextjs_app\n",
    "    working_dir: /app\n",
    "    environment:\n",

    "### **2. React App Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Creating the React App:*\n",
    "We initialized a new Next.js application in a directory named `react-app` using the command `npx create-next-app react-app`, opting to include features such as TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS to enhance the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Directory Structure:*\n",
    "We opted to use a `src/` directory for organizing our components and an app router for managing the routes in our application. Additionally, we customized the default import alias to streamline the import process in our project."

    "### Layout Component (`Layout.tsx`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Layout` component serves as a container for the various sections of your application. It includes a header, main content area, and a footer. The `Layout` component accepts `children` as a prop, which means other components can be nested within it.\n",

    "### Setting up Apollo Client\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   To facilitate interaction with the GraphQL API, set up the Apollo Client by running the following command in the project directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npm install @apollo/client graphql\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Apollo Client Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an Apollo Client instance to connect to the GraphQL server. Create a file named apolloClient.ts in the root of your project with the following code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```jsx\n",
    "    import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    export default apolloClient;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Setting Up GraphQL Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Next, create GraphQL queries to fetch data from the server. Create a file named getStocks.ts in a folder named graphql with the following content:\n",
    "    \n",

    "<blockquote>PostGraphile automatically generates GraphQL schemas from a Postgres database.

Essentially, `stockByTicker` serves as a bridge to access the stock name associated with each ticker in the portfolio summary.</blockquote>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Updating the React Component\n",
    "\n",
    "The `index.tsx` file, which defines the `HomePage` component, was updated to utilize the new GraphQL query. The portfolio summary section was modified to include an additional column for 'Stock Name'. This column displays the stock name fetched from the `stocks` table, using the joined query. \n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we successfully integrated the React application with GraphQL to perform a join operation between two database tables and display the merged data on the webpage. This showcases the power of GraphQL in fetching relational data effectively and the ease of integrating it with a React application using Apollo Client.\n"

    "## 2. Adding Flask App to Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "To containerize the Flask application, we use Docker, which allows for easier deployment and scaling. The Flask application is defined in a `Dockerfile` which specifies the base Python image, sets the working directory, and installs the necessary dependencies before copying the application files into the container. The Flask application is then added to the `docker-compose.yml` file, which orchestrates the deployment of various services, including the Flask app, Postgres database, and PostGraphile service. Here is a snippet from the `docker-compose.yml` file showing how the Flask app is added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "flask_app:\n",
    "  build: \n",
    "    context: .\n",
    "    dockerfile: flask-app/Dockerfile\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"5002:5000\"\n",
    "  networks:\n",
    "    - my-network\n",
    "  depends_on:\n",
    "    postgraphile:\n",
    "      condition: service_started\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Creating the Flask Application (app.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "We used Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, to create our application. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. In the app.py file, we defined various routes and functions to handle the necessary backend logic of our trading application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initializing the Flask App and CORS: We initialized the Flask application and enabled CORS to allow cross-origin requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining Helper Functions: We created helper functions to fetch stock prices and information using the yfinance package and format data appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GraphQL Endpoint Setup: We set up a GraphQL endpoint to interact with the PostGraphile service.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. API Endpoints: We defined two main API endpoints (/stock-price and /trade) to handle fetching stock prices and executing trades respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "import yfinance as yf\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "from flask_cors import CORS\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initializing Flask app and setting up GraphQL endpoint\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "CORS(app)\n",
    "GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = \"http://postgraphile:5000/graphql\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... (other function definitions)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/trade', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def trade_endpoint():\n",
    "  # ... (handling trade logic here)\n",
    "  # ... (executing GraphQL mutations to update database)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Updating the Database Using GraphQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The application uses GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to interact with the database. GraphQL allows for more precise and flexible queries compared to REST. In our Flask application, we defined various GraphQL mutations to update different tables in our database:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Updating Stocks Table: If a new stock is traded, we add it to the stocks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Updating Company Overview Table: We update the company overview table with the latest information fetched from the yfinance package.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Updating Portfolio Transactions Table: Every trade is recorded in the portfolio transactions table, which stores information about each transaction including the ticker symbol, transaction date, type of action (buy/sell), volume of shares, and the total transaction amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mutations are executed in the trade_endpoint function where the necessary data is gathered and the GraphQL mutations are constructed and executed to update the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def execute_graphql(query, variables=None):\n",
    "  response = requests.post(\n",
    "    GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, \n",
    "    json={'query': query, 'variables': variables},\n",
    "    headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n",
    "  )\n",
    "  return response.json()\n",
    "  \n",
    "# ... (usage within the trade_endpoint function to execute mutations)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive approach ensures that our trading application functions seamlessly, providing users with an intuitive and responsive interface to execute trades and view their portfolio."
